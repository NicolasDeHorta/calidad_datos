      "Title: Portraits of the Presidents: The National Portrait Gallery\n",
      "Description: A striking collection of presidential portraits from the National Portrait Gallery, this volume encapsulates the spirit of the most powerful office in the world. America's Presidents showcases the nation's largest collection of portraits of all the presidents beyond the White House's own, capturing the permanent exhibition that lies at the heart of the Portrait Gallery's mission to tell the American story through the individuals who have shaped it. The book explores presidential imagery through portraits ranging from the traditional, such as the iconic and newly restored \"Lansdowne\" portrait of George Washington by Gilbert Stuart, to the contemporary, such as Elaine de Kooning's colorful depiction of John F. Kennedy. Many of the featured portraits reveal much about the sitter, such as the intimate rendering of an informal George W. Bush by Robert Anderson and the fanciful, mosaic-like Chuck Close image of Bill Clinton. Some tell us more about the artist, such as the likeness of Franklin Delano Roosevelt that Douglas Chandor planned to include in a larger work about peace that would commemorate Roosevelt's Yalta meeting with wartime Allied leaders Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin. Works in other media, including sculptures and daguerreotypes, round out the presidential collection. Lively narratives accompany each piece, exploring the president's background and biography as well as the work's artistic and historical significance. Taken together, the portraits are a powerful visual exploration of the history of the highest office in the land and the diverse men who have held it.\n"

      "Removed line: Lincoln reconsidered,: Essays on the Civil War era,\"A \"\"brilliant\"\" look at America's sixteenth president by the New York Times-bestselling, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Lincoln (American Historical Review). First published in 1956 and revised and updated for the twenty-first century, Lincoln Reconsidered is a masterpiece of Civil War scholarship. In a dozen eloquent, witty, and incisive essays, the author of the definitive biography of Abraham Lincoln offers a fresh perspective on topics previously shrouded in myth and hagiography and brings the president's tough-mindedness, strategic acumen, and political flexibility into sharp focus. From Lincoln's patchwork education to his contradictory interpretations of the Constitution and the legacy of the Founding Fathers, David Herbert Donald reveals the legal mind behind the legend of the Great Emancipator. \"\"Toward a Reconsideration of the Abolitionists\"\" sheds new light on the radicalism of the antislavery movement, while \"\"Herndon and Mary Lincoln\"\" brilliantly characterizes the complicated relationship between two of the president's closest companions. \"\"Getting Right with Lincoln\"\" and \"\"The Folklore Lincoln\"\" draw on the methods of cultural anthropology to produce a provocative analysis of Lincoln as symbol. No historian has done more to enhance our understanding of Lincoln's presidency and the causes and effects of the Civil War than Donald. Lincoln Reconsidered is an entertaining and accessible introduction to his work and a must-read for every student of American history.\",['David Herbert Donald'],Open Road Media,2016-03-22\n",

Focusing on literary representations and selected examples from the visual arts, this book examines works by Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Christina Rossetti, George Eliot, Alfred Lord Tennyson and Walter Pater as well as by John Ruskin, Maria Rossetti and Arthur Henry Hallam. Julia Straub's analysis shows how the various representations of Beatrice in literature and in the visual arts reflect in meaningful ways some of the central social and aesthetic concerns of the Victorian period, most importantly its discourse on gender. This study offers fascinating insights into the Victorian reception of Dante by exploring the powerful appeal of his muse.\",['Julia Straub'],Bloomsbury Publishing,2011-11-03\n",

These historic beacons conjure myriad notions of a bygone era: romance, loneliness, and dependability; dedicated keepers manning the lights; eerie tales of haunted structures and ghosts of past keepers; mariners of yesteryear anxiously hoping to make safe haven around rocky shorelines. If these sentinels could talk, imagine the tales they would tell of ferocious Great Lakes storms taking their toll on vessels and people alike. In this fully updated edition of Wisconsin Lighthouses, Ken and Barb Wardius tell those tales, taking readers on an intimate tour of lighthouses on Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, and Lake Winnebago. Both delightful storytellers and accomplished photographers, the couple complement their engaging text with more than 100 stunning color photographs, along with dozens of archival photos, maps, documents, and artifacts. Detailed \"\"how to get there\"\" directions, up-to-the-minute status reports on each light, and sidebars on everything from lighthouse vocabulary to the often lonely lives of lightkeepers make this the definitive book on Wisconsin's lighthouses.\",\"['Ken Wardius', 'Barb Wardius']\",Wisconsin Historical Society,2013-10-17\n",

He was Sick Of their incessant cheering, irritated by their enthusiasm. He was smiling contemptuously as he watched the parade, but his face twitched nervously in the red glare of the torches. He had gathered his long cloak around him in his favorite theatrical pose, for even in his misery he was still the actor. Yet his unhappiness was real enough. His mind was numbed with fatigue and disaster. For two days he had been unable to sleep at all. Minute guns had been fired in an endless salvo Of victory, and their thunder had beaten like hammer blows against his brain until he had found himself Counting Off the seconds in order to anticipate each explosion. And through all the confusion of sounds and images came the realization that his beloved South was being crushed in defeat. That thought was with him al ways, and there was no escaping it.

They were the principal model for Virgil in the Eclogues, and their influence can be seen in the work of Petrarch and Milton. Although it is the pastoral poems for which he is chiefly famous, Theocritus also wrote hymns to the gods, brilliant mime depictions of everyday life, short narrative epics, epigrams, and encomia of the powerful.

The papacy was no more the church than the empire was feudalism. The church was Christendom and Christendom was the totality of European civilization. It was a way of life which had for its first purpose the worship of God and after that the civilization of man. Its members were the inhabitants of western Europe led and comforted by their parish priests, ruled-and according to chance-abused or protected by their lords and bishops, who together glimpsed only occasionally and from afar the passing might and splendor of emperors and popes.

      "Removed line: Atheism in Christianity,: The religion of the Exodus and the Kingdom,\"In the twenty-first century, religion has come under determined attack from secular progressives in documentaries, opinion pieces and international bestsellers. Combative atheists have denounced faiths of every stripe, resulting in a crude intellectual polarization in which religious convictions and heritage must be rejected or accepted wholesale. In the long unavailable Atheism in Christianity, Ernst Bloch provides a way out from this either/or debate. He examines the origins of Christianity in an attempt to find its social roots, pursuing a detailed study of the Bible and its fascination for 'ordinary and unimportant' people. In the biblical promise of utopia and the scriptures' antagonism to authority, Bloch locates Christianity's appeal to the oppressed. Through a lyrical yet close and nuanced analysis, he explores the tensions within the Bible that promote atheism as a counter to the authoritarian metaphysical theism imposed by clerical exegesis. At the Bible's heart he finds a heretical core and the concealed message that, paradoxically, a good Christian must necessarily be a good atheist.This new edition includes an introduction by Peter Thompson, the Director of the Centre for Enrst Bloch Studies at the University of Sheffield.\",['Ernst Bloch'],Verso Books,2009-06-01\n",

Originally titled The Red Decade: Stalinist Penetration of America, this work describes a period in American history in the 1930s characterized by a widespread infatuation with communism in general and Stalinism in particular. Lyons believed this idolization of Joseph Stalin and of Bolshevik achievements to have reached its high point in 1938, running deepest amongst liberals, intellectuals, and journalists and even some government and federal officials.

He followed the trails of old explorers, encountered river bandits, wild tribesmen, and the evidence of ancient ruins, and discovered fossils in the depths of the Peruvian jungle. Filled with observations and descriptions of the people and the fading wildlife of this vast world to the south, The Cloud Forest is his incisive, wry report of his expedition into some of the last and most exotic wild terrains in the world.

      "Removed line: Lorna Doone,: A romance of Exmoor (World's classics),\"'Every woman clutched her child, and every man turned pale at the very name of Doone' John Ridd, an unsophisticated farmer, falls in love with the beautiful and aristocratic Lorna Doone, kidnapped as a child by the outlaw Doones on Exmoor. Ridd's rivalry with the villainous Carver Doone reaches a dramatic climax that will determine Lorna's future happiness. First published in 1869, Lorna Doone was praised by R. L. Stevenson and Thomas Hardy and has remained constantly in print. The novel has many aspects: it is a romance; a historical novel set at the time of the Monmouth Rebellion in the seventeenth century; and a new development in the pastoral tradition. Underneath an ostensibly idyllic evocation of rural bliss and tale of love and high adventure lies a solid defence of Victorian social values, and a hero whose self-doubt prompts him constantly to prove himself.

      "Removed line: Christopher Marlowe,,\"Christopher Marlowe: Poet & Spy is the most thorough and detailed life of Marlowe since John Bakeless's in 1942. It has new material on Marlowe in relation to Canterbury, also on his home life, schooling, and six and a half years at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and includes fresh data on his reading, teachers, and early achievements, including a new letter with a new date for the famous 'putative portrait' of Marlowe at Cambridge. The biography uses for the first time the Latin writings of his friend Thomas Watson to illuminate Marlowe's life in London and his career as a spy (that is, as a courier and agent for the Elizabethan Privy Council). There are new accounts of him on the continent, particularly at Flushing or Vlissingen, where he was arrested. The book also more fully explains Marlowe's relations with his chief patron, Thomas Walsingham, than ever before. This is also the first biography to explore in detail Marlowe's relations with fellow playwrights such as Kyd and Shakespeare, and to show how Marlowe's relations with Shakespeare evolved from 1590 to 1593. With closer views of him in relation to the Elizabethan stage than have appeared in any biography, the book examines in detail his aims, mind, and techniques as exhibited in all of his plays, from Dido, the Tamburlaine dramas, and Doctor Faustus through to The Jew of Malta and Edward II. It offers new treatments of his evolving versions of 'The Passionate Shepherd', and displays circumstances, influences, and the bearings of Shakespeare's 'Venus and Adonis' in relation to Marlowe's 'Hero and Leander'. Throughout, there is a strong emphasis on Marlowe's friendships and so-called 'homosexuality'. Fresh information is brought to bear on his seductive use of blasphemy, his street fights, his methods of preparing himself for writing, and his atheism and religious interests. The book also explores his attraction to scientists and mathematicians such as Thomas Harriot and others in the Ralegh-Northumberland set of thinkers and experimenters. Finally, there is new data on spies and business agents such as Robert Poley, Nicholas Skeres, and Ingram Frizer, and a more exact account of the circumstances that led up to Marlowe's murder.\",['Park Honan'],OUP Oxford,2007-08-16\n",

      "Removed line: Raymond Poincar&#233,,\"The book describes the life of Henri Poincar?, his work style and in detail most of his unique achievements in mathematics and physics. Apart from biographical details, attention is given to Poincar?'s contributions to automorphic functions, differential equations and dynamical systems, celestial mechanics, mathematical physics in particular the theory of the electron and relativity, topology (analysis situs). A chapter on philosophy explains Poincar?'s conventionalism in mathematics and his view of conventionalism in physics; the latter has a very different character. In the foundations of mathematics his position is between intuitionism and axiomatics. One of the purposes of the book is to show how Poincar? reached his fundamentally new results in many different fields, how he thought and how one should read him. One of the new aspects is the description of two large fields of his attention: dynamical systems as presented in his book on `new methods for celestial mechanics' and his theoretical physics papers. At the same time it will be made clear how analysis and geometry are intertwined in Poincar?'s thinking and work.In dynamical systems this becomes clear in his description of invariant manifolds, his association of differential equation flow with mappings and his fixed points theory. There is no comparable book on Poincar?, presenting such a relatively complete vision of his life and achievements. There exist some older biographies in the French language, but they pay only restricted attention to his actual work. The reader can obtain from this book many insights in the working of a very original mind while at the same time learning about fundamental results for modern science\",['Ferdinand Verhulst'],Springer Science & Business Media,2012-08-11\n",

En als die diepe wens gestild lijkt in een relatie, waarom volgen er dan zo vaak teleurstellingen? Met deze en andere vragen gaat Jacob Slavenburg op onderzoek uit. Zijn reis begint op het terrein van de uiterlijke geschiedenis, bij de tijdperken van de grote Moedergodin, en van het patriarchaat. Daarna onderzoekt hij de beweging achter de historische feiten. Was er werkelijk een splitsing in mannelijk en vrouwelijk en waar zou deze dan voor dienen? Via een omweg naar de hemel maken auteur en lezer kennis met het fenomeen tweelingzielen. Ten slotte, terug op aarde, valt ons de chemie op tussen het mannelijke en het vrouwelijke. Hier vinden we licht en duisternis, animus en anima, man en vrouw. Hier kunnen we ons van die schijnbare tegenstellingen bewust worden; hier vinden we antwoorden op onze vragen. Cultuurhistoricus drs. Jacob Slavenburg kreeg vooral bekendheid dankzij zijn uitgave van de spectaculaire Nag Hammadi-geschriften die in Egypte ontdekt werden.

      "Removed line: Mallarm&#233,'s Prose Poems: A Critical Study (Cambridge Studies in French),\"This book challenges and replaces the existing view of Mallarm? mission to 're-possess' music on behalf of poetic language. Traditionally, this view focused on only the last fifteen years of the poet's life, and sprang from a belief in Mallarm? 'sudden awakening' to music during an all-Wagner concert in Paris, in 1885. Professor Heath Lees shows that Mallarm? early knowledge and experience of music was much greater than commentators have realized, and that the French poet actually began his writing career with the explicit aim of making music's performance-language of 'effect' the ground of his poetic expression. Integral to the argument is Mallarm? reaction to the work and ideas of Richard Wagner, whose impact on France came in two waves: the first broke during the tempestuous 1860s days of the Paris Tannh?er, while the second arrived in the mid-1880s, and gave birth to the Revue Wagn?enne. In refuting the critical literature that focuses on only the second of these waves, Lees shows that Mallarm?xhibited a highly informed Wagnerian background during the first wave, and that his grasp of the composer's gestural motives and flexible musical prose led him towards a new kind of self-expressive, gestural rhythm that aimed musically to reinvent poetic language. In support of this, the book examines closely what Wagner 'really' said in the prose works that were becoming known in Paris by the 1860s, in particular, Wagner's important French text, the Lettre sur la musique. It also re-examines Baudelaire's classic Wagner-brochure, and reveals its author's surprisingly firm grasp of Wagner's musico-poetic fusion. In musically informed commentary, Professor Lees surveys the four decades of success and failure that resulted from Mallarm? repeated attempts to draw out the musical gestures and resonances of words alone. In the process, he throws new light on many of Mallarm? best-known texts, hitherto judged 'difficult' by those who have failed to\",['Heath Lees'],Routledge,2017-07-05\n",

In this story of an era in American life, the figure of Calvin Coolidge, a curious reversion to an old type, stands out in contrast to the vivid color of a gorgeous epoch. The history of the Coolidge bull market in detail from 1921, when Coolidge came to Washington as Vice President, until 1929, when he left Washington and public life, had not been written before. As that market boomed, Calvin Coolidge as President, having all the virtues needed for another day, moved through the turmoil of the times earnestly, honestly, courageously trying to understand his country's economic development and to act upon his understanding of a movement that baffled him and left him futile. Mr. White talked to hundreds of people who knew and were associated with President Coolidge in those days. Cabinet members, friends, White House associates, reporters, business men, big and little; and his story throws a new light upon the inside of the White House, and upon the President through the years.\",['William Allen White'],Pickle Partners Publishing,2018-12-02\n",

With his customary urbanity, James assesses the place of the writer in nineteenth-century America, and touches upon the antithetical values of the Old World and the New.

      "Removed line: The Microsoft&reg, Crabby Office Lady Tells It Like It Is: Secrets to Surviving Office Life,\"Imagine if you could see the playbook that returned a struggling tech empire to the top of the tech leaderboard. The Microsoft Story will help you understand and adopt the competitive strategies, workplace culture, and daily business practices that enabled the tech company to once again become a leading tech innovator. It wasn't so long ago that Microsoft and its Windows operating system dominated the tech industry so much so that they faced antitrust charges for what was perceived by many to be predatory, monopolistic practices. Less than a decade later, the tide had turned and Microsoft lost its dominance in the personal tech marketplace amidst the launch of the iPhone, the rise of Google, and the cloud computing phenomenon. But, now, Microsoft is back on top. The company's value is soaring and once again Microsoft is being recognized as a tech leader once again. What changed? Since Satya Nadella took over as CEO, the company has gone through significant changes. The company culture has become one of creativity and innovation, no longer requiring that all products revolve around Windows. The company has reevaluated their business lines, getting rid of underperforming initiatives such as smartphones, and focused on the area of growth where the company excelled:the cloud. Through the story of Microsoft, you'll learn: How to build a nimble company culture that supports innovation and growth. How to return a forgotten brand to the spotlight. How to recognize and build upon successful business lines, while letting go of underperforming initiatives. When to change the entire way you do business.

      "Removed line: Pilgrimage: The Book of the People, The Weird and Fantastic Earth Adventures of Beings from a Far Planet,\"A monumental, genre-defying novel that David Mitchell calls \"\"Michel Faber's second masterpiece,\"\" The Book of Strange New Things is a masterwork from a writer in full command of his many talents. It begins with Peter, a devoted man of faith, as he is called to the mission of a lifetime, one that takes him galaxies away from his wife, Bea. Peter becomes immersed in the mysteries of an astonishing new environment, overseen by an enigmatic corporation known only as USIC. His work introduces him to a seemingly friendly native population struggling with a dangerous illness and hungry for Peter's teachings-his Bible is their \"\"book of strange new things.\"\" But Peter is rattled when Bea's letters from home become increasingly desperate: typhoons and earthquakes are devastating whole countries, and governments are crumbling. Bea's faith, once the guiding light of their lives, begins to falter. Suddenly, a separation measured by an otherworldly distance, and defined both by one newly discovered world and another in a state of collapse, is threatened by an ever-widening gulf that is much less quantifiable. While Peter is reconciling the needs of his congregation with the desires of his strange employer, Bea is struggling for survival. Their trials lay bare a profound meditation on faith, love tested beyond endurance, and our responsibility to those closest to us. Marked by the same bravura storytelling and precise language that made The Crimson Petal and the White such an international success, The Book of Strange New Things is extraordinary, mesmerizing, and replete with emotional complexity and genuine pathos.\",['Michel Faber'],Hogarth,2014-10-28\n",

This book looks in detail at the military operations that occurred in Louisiana-most of them minor skirmishes, but some of them battles and campaigns of major importance. The Civil War in Louisiana begins with the first talk of secession in the state and ends with the last tragic days of the war. John D. Winters describes with great fervor and detail such events as the fall of Confederate New Orleans and the burning of Alexandria. In addition to military action, Winters discusses the political, economic, and social aspects of the war in Louisiana. His accounts of battles and the men who waged them provide a fuller story of Louisiana in the Civil War than has ever before been told.\",['John D. Winters'],LSU Press,1991-08-01\n",

The flood of praise for its design, however, can obscure the many lessons from the long struggle to develop the project. Nothing was built on the site for more than a decade after the first master plan was approved, and the redevelopment agency flirted with bankruptcy in 1979. Taking a practice-oriented approach, the book examines the role of planning and development agencies in implementing urban waterfront redevelopment. It focuses upon the experience of the central actor - the Battery Park City Authority (BPCA) - and includes personal interviews with executives of the BPCA, former New York mayors John Lindsay and Ed Koch, key public officials, planners, and developers. Describing the political, financial, planning, and implementation issues faced by public agencies and private developers from 1962 to 1993, it is both a case study and history of one of the most ambitious examples of urban waterfront redevelopment.\",['David L.

This novel, which Giono began writing in 1934 and which was published in 1951, expanded and solidified his reputation as one of Europe's most important writers. This is a novel of adventure, a roman courtois, that tells the story of Angelo, a nobleman who has been forced to leave Italy because of a duel, and is returning to his homeland by way of Provence. But that region is in the grip of a cholera epidemic, travelers are being imprisoned behind barricades, and exposure to the disease is almost certain. Angelo's escapades, adventures, and heroic self-sacrifice in this hot, hallucinatory landscape, among corpses, criminals and rioting townspeople, share this epic tale.\",['Jean Giono'],North Point Press,2014-12-23\n",

In the events and musings recorded here we find the seeds of those themes that obsessed him throughout his career and imbued his classic novels The Immoralist and The Counterfeiters. Gide led a life of uncompromising self-scrutiny, and his literary works resembled moments of that life. With If It Die, Gide determined to relay without sentiment or embellishment the circumstances of his childhood and the birth of his philosophic wanderings, and in doing so to bring it all to light. Gide's unapologetic account of his awakening homosexual desire and his portrait of Oscar Wilde and Lord Alfred Douglas as they indulged in debauchery in North Africa are thrilling in their frankness and alone make If It Die an essential companion to the work of a twentieth-century literary master.\",['Andre Gide'],Vintage,2014-12-17\n",

From this raw material Robert Graves brilliantly recreates a world of power, intrigue and cruelty, a world permeated through and through with the threat of sudden and violent death. In the process he raises striking, sometimes unanswerable questions: was Tiberius really as depraved as Suetonius suggests? Was Livia the true power behind Augustus' throne? And did she really poison all those people? Did Caligula seriously plan to make his horse a consul?

      "Removed line: Howl at the moon,,\"Show biz memoir at its name-dropping, bridge-burning, profane best: the music industry's most outspoken, outrageous, and phenomenally successful executive delivers a rollicking memoir of pop music's heyday. During the 1970s and '80s the music business was dominated by a few major labels and artists such as Michael Jackson, Bruce Springsteen, the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Billy Joel, Paul Simon, Barbra Streisand and James Taylor. They were all under contract to CBS Records, making it the most successful label of the era. And, as the company's president, Walter Yetnikoff was the ruling monarch. He was also the most flamboyant, volatile and controversial personality to emerge from an industry and era defined by sex, drugs and debauchery. Having risen from working-class Brooklyn and the legal department of CBS, Yetnikoff, who freely admitted to being tone deaf, was an unlikely label head. But he had an uncanny knack for fostering talent and intimidating rivals with his appalling behavior-usually fueled by an explosive combination of cocaine and alcohol. His tantrums, appetite for mind-altering substances and sexual exploits were legendary. In Japan to meet the Sony executives who acquired CBS during his tenure, Walter was assigned a minder who confined him to a hotel room. True to form, Walter raided the minibar, got blasted and, seeing no other means of escape, opened a hotel window and vented his rage by literally howling at the moon. In Howling at the Moon, Yetnikoff traces his journey as he climbed the corporate mountain, danced on its summit and crashed and burned. We see how Walter became the father-confessor to Michael Jackson as the King of Pop reconstructed his face and agonized over his image while constructing Thriller (and how, after it won seven Grammies, Jackson made the preposterous demand that Walter take producer Quincy Jones's name off the album); we see Walter, in maniacal pursuit of a contract, chase the Rolling Stones around the world and nearly come to blows with Mick Jagger in the process; we get the tale of how Walter and Marvin Gaye-fresh from the success of \"\"Sexual Healing\"\"-share the same woman, and of how Walter bonds with Bob Dylan because of their mutual Jewishness. At the same time we witness Yetnikoff's clashes with Barry Diller, David Geffen, Tommy Mottola, Allen Grubman and a host of others. Seemingly, the more Yetnikoff feeds his cravings for power, sex, liquor and cocaine, the more profitable CBS becomes-from $485 million to well over $2 billion-until he finally succumbs, ironically, not to substances, but to a corporate coup. Reflecting on the sinister cycle that left his career in tatters and CBS flush with cash, Yetnikoff emerges with a hunger for redemption and a new reverence for his working-class Brooklyn roots. Ruthlessly candid, uproariously hilarious and compulsively readable, Howling at the Moon is a blistering You'll Never Eat Lunch in this Town Again of the music industry.\",\"['Walter Yetnikoff', 'David Ritz']\",Crown,2004-03-02\n",

      "Removed line: Bending the twig,: The revolution in education and its effect on our children,\"'Tis education forms the common mind Just as the twig is bent the tree's inclined -Alexander Pope Augustin G. Rudd in his book, Bending the Twig, clearly points out the implications of a program of liberal teacher training, and its effect on the public schools of the United States where the notions of Progressive or New Education have directly or indirectly influenced every level of our educational system. Part II of this book is especially valuable for its definition of the path the social educators are following. Augustin contrasts the concept of a free society based on the primacy of the individual with the concept of the statist order advocated by many of the New Educators who choose to use the schools as an instrument for social change rather than an agency for instruction in the skills, knowledges, and heritage necessary to maintain our culture. It is interesting to know that the Russians experimented with progressive education until its bad results became evident. Then, using their centralized power, they eliminated it. This return to the essentials of education may have aided Russia in making her recent technological advances. After reading this book, one comes away with the feeling that as generation after generation of students graduate from our schools conditioned to the tenets of socialism, we will eventually lose our republican form of government and individual liberty because our citizens will lack even the basic knowledge of our heritage.-FRANK B.

In doing so, it explodes the stereotypes that have shaped and distorted our thinking about African Americans--both in slavery and in freedom. Beginning with John Robert Bond, who emigrated from England to fight in the Union Army during the Civil War and married a recently freed slave, Alexander shows three generations of Bonds as they take chances and break new ground. From Victorian England to antebellum Virginia, from Herman Melville's New England to the Jim Crow South, from urban race riots to the battlefields of World War I, this fascinating chronicle sheds new light on eighty crucial years in our nation's troubled history. The Bond family's rise from slavery, their interaction with prominent figures such as W. E. B. DuBois and Booker T.

According to Joshua Trachtenberg, it is not possible truly to understand the experience and history of the Jewish people without attempting to recover their folklife and beliefs from centuries past. Jewish Magic and Superstition is a masterful and utterly fascinating exploration of religious forms that have all but disappeared yet persist in the imagination. The volume begins with legends of Jewish sorcery and proceeds to discuss beliefs about the evil eye, spirits of the dead, powers of good, the famous legend of the golem, procedures for casting spells, the use of gems and amulets, how to battle spirits, the ritual of circumcision, herbal folk remedies, fortune telling, astrology, and the interpretation of dreams. First published more than sixty years ago, Trachtenberg's study remains the foundational scholarship on magical practices in the Jewish world and offers an understanding of folk beliefs that expressed most eloquently the everyday religion of the Jewish people.\",['Joshua Trachtenberg'],University of Pennsylvania Press,2012-10-08\n",

      "Removed line: The Logico-algebraic approach to quantum mechanics (The University of Western Ontario series in philosophy of science , v. 5),\"The twentieth century has witnessed a striking transformation in the understanding of the theories of mathematical physics. There has emerged clearly the idea that physical theories are significantly characterized by their abstract mathematical structure. This is in opposition to the tradi tional opinion that one should look to the specific applications of a theory in orrter to understand it. One might with reason now espouse the view that to understand the deeper character of a theory one must know its abstract structure and understand the significance of that structure, while to understand how a theory might be modified in light of its experimental inadequacies one must be intimately acquainted with how it is applied. Quantum theory itself has gone through a development this century which illustrates strikingly the shifting perspective. From a collection of intuitive physical manoeuvers under Bohr, through a formative stage in which the mathematical framework was bifurcated (between Schrodinger and Heisenberg) to an elegant culmination in von Neumann's Hilbert space formulation, the elementary theory moved, flanked even at this later stage by the ill-understood formalisms for the relativistic version and for the field-theoretic alternative; after that we have a gradual, but constant, elaboration of all these quantal theories as abstract mathematical structures (their point of departure being von Neumann's formalism) until at the present time theoretical work is heavily preoccupied with the manipulation of purely abstract structures.\",['C.A.

      "Removed line: The Nuremberg Trial, A History of Nazi Germany as Revealed through t,\"Organized in the immediate aftermath of World War II to try the former Nazi leaders for war crimes, the Nuremberg trials, known as the International Military Tribunal (IMT), paved the way for global conversations about genocide, justice, and human rights that continue to this day. As Francine Hirsch reveals in this immersive new history of the trials, a central piece of the story has been routinely omitted from standard accounts: the critical role that the Soviet Union played in making Nuremberg happen in the first place. Hirsch's book reveals how the Soviets shaped the trials--only to be written out of their story as Western allies became bitter Cold War rivals. Soviet Judgment at Nuremberg offers the first full picture of the war trials, illuminating the many ironies brought to bear as the Soviets did their part to bring the Nazis to justice. Everyone knew that Stalin had originally allied with Hitler before the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939 hung heavy over the courtroom, as did the suspicion among the Western prosecutors and judges that the Soviets had falsified evidence in an attempt to pin one of their own war crimes, the Katyn massacre of Polish officers, on the Nazis. It did not help that key members of the Soviet delegation, including the Soviet judge and chief prosecutor, had played critical roles in Stalin's infamous show trials of the 1930s. For the lead American prosecutor Robert H. Jackson and his colleagues, Soviet participation in the Nuremberg Trials undermined their overall credibility and possibly even the moral righteousness of the Allied victory. Yet Soviet jurists had been the first to conceive of a legal framework that treated war as an international crime. Without it, the IMT would have had no basis for judgment. The Soviets had borne the brunt of the fighting against Germany--enduring the horrors of the Nazi occupation and experiencing almost unimaginable human losses and devastation. There would be no denying their place on the tribunal, nor their determination to make the most of it. Once the trials were set in motion, however, little went as the Soviets had planned. Soviet Judgment at Nuremberg shows how Stalin's efforts to direct the Soviet delegation and to steer the trials from afar backfired, and how Soviet war crimes became exposed in open court. Hirsch's book offers readers both a front-row seat in the courtroom and a behind-the-scenes look at the meetings in which the prosecutors shared secrets and forged alliances. It reveals the shifting relationships among the four countries of the prosecution (the U.S., Great Britain, France, and the USSR), uncovering how and why the Palace of Justice in Nuremberg became a Cold War battleground. In the process Soviet Judgment at Nuremberg offers a new understanding of the trials and a fresh perspective on the post-war movement for human rights.\",['Francine Hirsch'],Oxford University Press,2020-04-23\n",

      "Removed line: Susan Point: Coast Salish Artist,\"Native American Salish artist Susan Point did not take up art until she was in her late twenties, but since then has immersed herself in the study of traditional Coast Salish art and culture. She says: \"\"Coast Salish art is relatively unknown to most people today as it was an almost lost art form after European contact -- the reason being that Salish lands were the first to be settled by Europeans. Because of this, over the years, I have spent a great deal of my time trying to revive traditional Coast Salish art -- and also attempting to educate the public to the fact that there was, and still is, another art indigenous to the central Pacific Northwest Coast\"\". Point's striking and distinctive art -- from jewelry in precious metals to prints, paintings, and monumental pieces in wood and glass -- has won worldwide acclaim and a worldwide audience. An innovator with a strong personal style, she likes to express ancestral concepts and designs in media such as glass and bronze as well as the more traditional wood. \"\"In creating my art\"\", she says, \"\"I feel a need to continually express my cultural background and beliefs yet, at the same time, my work continues to evolve with changes both within and outside of my community\"\". Michael Kew describes the traditional art, culture, and beliefs of the central Coast Salish, which of all the Northwest Coast cultures is among the least familiar to the general public. Because much of the art was closely associated with private religious expression, it was seldom displayed or sold to collectors. Peter Macnair contributes an engaging and enlightening biography that looks at the artistic evolution of Susan Point. Bill McLennan briefly examines thetradition of housepost carving among the Coast Salish and Susan Point's interpretations of these large woodcarvings.\",\"['Gary Wyatt', 'Michael Kew', 'Kenji Nagai']\",Douglas & McIntyre , Seattle : University of Washington Press,2000\n",

      "Removed line: The dark invader,: Wartime reminiscences of a German naval intelligence officer,\"Men engaged in Intelligence Services during a war divide their particular opponents into two classes. One consists of neutrals who go out of their way to help the enemy for the sake of gain; and for such men we have not much compassion should they fall upon misfortune. They are interfering in great matters with which they are not concerned, in order to make a little money. The other class is made up of men who, abandoning the opportunities of their own careers, go secretly away in the sacred service of their country, play a lone hand, and run the gauntlet of foreign laws. For such we can have nothing but respect while the fight is going on and friendship when it is over. Captain Franz von Rintelen belongs to this latter class. A young naval officer with every likelihood of reaching to high rank, he went abroad in 1915 and only saw his own country again after the lapse of six strenuous and, in part, unhappy years. The history of those years is told in this book. The conversations which he records depend, of course, upon his memory; the main facts we are able to check, and we know them to be exact. The book is written, as one would expect from his record, without the least rancour, and I think I am not trenching upon the province of criticism when I add-with admirable simplicity. It is a record which is more detailed and concerned with endeavours on a vastly wider scale than is usual in such accounts. One cannot, I think, read it without recognising, apart from the magnitude of the things attempted and done, the terrific strain under which he lived; and this gives a moving and human quality to the narrative which sets it a little apart from any other which I have read. Those who are most saturated in spy stories will find much to surprise them in this volume, and they will not be likely to forget the poignant minutes which he spent on the top of an omnibus in London and the way in which those minutes ended. Finally, here is as good an argument against War as a man could find in twenty volumes devoted to that subject alone.\",['Captain Franz von Rintelen'],Pickle Partners Publishing,2016-07-26\n",

South is the remarkable tale of the ill-fated expedition, told in Shackleton's own words-breathtakingly illustrated in this unique edition with photography from the expedition, modern images of the Antarctic, and newly discovered photos from the Ross Sea Party. This handsome edition, first published in 2016, is presented in paperback to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the original publication and features images by expedition photographer Frank Hurley, modern color photography of the fauna and vistas the men encountered, as well as long-lost photos taken by the expedition's Ross Sea Party and discovered in 2013. The expedition's story begins on the eve of World War I, when the ship Endurance departed England with Shackleton and his team of six men. The plan was to travel 1,800 miles across the icy continent from the Atlantic side, while a second team aboard the Aurora, would reach Antarctica's Pacific side and lay out supply depots for the advancing team. As the Endurance approached the continent, however, it became hopelessly locked in an ice floe, beginning a series of harrowing travails. Today considered an adventure survival classic, South is the true story of a thrilling polar expedition. Never before has Shackleton's lively prose been so extensively and stunningly illustrated.\",['Ernest Henry Shackleton Sir'],Voyageur Press,2019-03-19\n",
      "Removed line: Tide&#146,s Table: Maritime Cooking from the Inn on the Cove,\"A Sunday Times 'Must Read' book. Described by the Sunday Times as \"\"a gently studious Bill Bryson crossed with an upbeat and relaxed WG Sebald\"\", Tide is \"\"a superb book... a delight to read. It is profound and powerful, and should win prizes.\"\" From Cnut to D-Day, the history and science of the unceasing tide is explored for the first time. Half of the world's population lives in coastal regions lapped by tidal waters. Yet how little most of us know about the tide - a key force on our planet that has altered the course of history and will transform our future. Our ability to predict and understand the tide depends on centuries of science, from the observations of Aristotle and the theories of Newton to today's supercomputer calculations. This story is punctuated here by notable tidal episodes in history, from Caesar's thwarted invasion of Britain to the catastrophic flooding of Venice, and interwoven with a rich folklore that continues to inspire art and literature today. With Aldersey-Williams as our guide to the most feared and celebrated tidal features on the planet, from the original maelstr?m in Scandinavia to the world's highest tides in Nova Scotia to the crumbling coast of East Anglia, the importance of the tide, and the way it has shaped - and will continue to shape - our civilization, becomes startlingly clear.\",['Hugh Aldersey-Williams'],Viking,2017-03-02\n",

In the land of Dorthar, the Storm Lord reigns as king. According to law, the Storm Lord's youngest son will be the rightful heir. His queen, the cunning and ambitious Val Mara, intends her young son, Amrek, to be that heir. But fate has other ideas. When the Storm Lord abducts a Lowlander priestess, conceives a child with her, and then dies in mysterious circumstances, the unborn baby of that union suddenly becomes the heir to a vast kingdom--a situation that Val Mara is eager to rectify. When his mother also dies, the infant, Raldnor, must be taken far from the Storm Lord's stronghold to escape the queen's murderous wrath, forsaking all knowledge of his royal heritage. Raldnor grows up among the people of the Plains, but he is set apart from his friends and neighbors by the mystery of his past. Meanwhile, Amrek has taken the throne as his mother intended. If Raldnor is to reclaim his destiny and defeat the usurper who has taken his place, he will have to survive trials of strength, political sabotage, and threats against his life, regaining his birthright as the true Storm Lord of Dorthar.\",['Tanith Lee'],Wars of VIS,2017-07-04\n",

William Foote Whyte's account of the Italian American slum he called \"\"Cornerville\"\"--Boston's North End--has been the model for urban ethnography for fifty years. By mapping the intricate social worlds of street gangs and \"\"corner boys,\"\" Whyte was among the first to demonstrate that a poor community need not be socially disorganized. His writing set a standard for vivid portrayals of real people in real situations. And his frank discussion of his methodology--participant observation--has served as an essential casebook in field research for generations of students and scholars. This fiftieth anniversary edition includes a new preface and revisions to the methodological appendix. In a new section on the book's legacy, Whyte responds to recent challenges to the validity, interpretation, and uses of his data. \"\"The Whyte Impact on the Underdog,\"\" the moving statement by a gang leader who became the author's first research assistant, is preserved. \"\"Street Corner Society broke new ground and set a standard for field research in American cities that remains a source of intellectual challenge.\"\"--Robert Washington, Reviews in Anthropology\",['William Foote Whyte'],,1981\n",

      "Removed line: King Solomon's Ring,: New Light on Animal Ways,\"2020 Reprint of the 1952 Edition. Exact facsimile of the original edition and not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. The book's title refers to the legendary Seal of Solomon, a ring that supposedly gave King Solomon the power to speak to animals. Lorenz claims that he likewise achieved this feat of communication with several species. He accomplished this by raising them in and around his home and observing their behavior. King Solomon's Ring describes the methods of his investigation, and his resulting findings about animal psychology. Lorenz's findings include the surprisingly refined social system of the common Eurasian jackdaw, the uncanny behavior and bodily features of the tiny water shrew, and the surprisingly complex interactions of seemingly unintelligent aquarium fish. He interlards his narrative with anecdotes based on his unusual methods, without which he could not have made many of his observations. King Solomon's Ring dispels several common misconceptions about animals' intelligence, but at the same time points out many of their similarities with humans, although some of these similarities come from speculative extrapolations (in fact, Lorenz has been criticized for excessive anthropomorphism). King Solomon's Ring also addresses the issue of keeping pets. Lorenz praises the benefits that a pet owner derives from his pet, however, he also describes the hazards that an animal can pose to the inhabitants and material contents of a house, and the ways in which a pet's captivity can make it miserable, and explains how to avoid each of these causes for discontent. A few of the findings it presents have found their way into common knowledge since its publication, such as the phenomenon of imprinting. 'It is one of the best and most penetrating non-technical books about animals and animal nature that has ever been written ... every sensitive reader will agree that the book is a work of humanity, wisdom and balance as well as of delightful humour.' - W H Thorpe Contents: Animals as a nuisance -- Something that does no danage: the aquarium -- Robbery in the aquarium -- Poor fish -- Laughing at animals -- Pitying animals -- Buying animals -- The language of animals -- The taming of the shrew -- The covenant -- The perennial retainers -- Morals and weapons.\",['Konrad Lorenz'],,2020-06-11\n",

Hinton's award-winning experience translating a wide range of ancient Chinese poets makes these books sing in English as never before. But these new versions are not only inviting and immensely readable, they also apply much-needed consistency to key philosophical terms in these texts, lending structural links and philosophical rigor heretofore unavailable in English. Breathing new life into these originary classics, Hinton's new translations will stand as the definitive texts for our era. Perhaps the most broadly influential spiritual text in human history, Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching is the source of Taoist philosophy, which eventually developed into Ch'an (Zen) Buddhism. Equally influential in the social sphere, Confucious' Analects is the source of social wisdom in China. The Chuang Tzu is the wild and wacky prose complement to the Tao Te Ching. And with its philosophical story-telling, the Menicius adds depth and complexity to Confucius' vision.\",,Catapult,2013-11-18\n",
      "Removed line: The Analects of Confucius,,\"This carefully crafted ebook: \"\"Classic The Analects (The Revised James Legge Translation)\"\" is formatted for your eReader with a functional and detailed table of contents. This book is the revised James Legge translation which has been extensively reworked and restored compared to the freely available Legge translations. The Analects, also known as the Analects of Confucius, is the collection of sayings and ideas attributed to the Chinese philosopher Confucius and his contemporaries, traditionally believed to have been written by Confucius' followers. It is believed to have been written during the Warring States period (475 BC-221 BC), and it achieved its final form during the mid-Han dynasty (206 BC-220 AD). By the early Han dynasty the Analects was considered merely a \"\"commentary\"\" on the Five Classics, but the status of the Analects grew to be one of the central texts of Confucianism by the end of that dynasty. During the late Song dynasty (960-1279) the importance of the Analects as a philosophy work was raised above that of the older Five Classics, and it was recognized as one of the \"\"Four Books\"\". The Analects has been one of the most widely read and studied books in China for the last 2,000 years, and continues to have a substantial influence on Chinese and East Asian thought and values today. Confucius (551-479 BC) was a Chinese teacher, editor, politician, and philosopher of the Spring and Autumn period of Chinese history.\",['Confucius'],e-artnow,2013-09-05\n",

In 1940 Hitler sent his troops to execute the Fall of France. A six-week battle with lightning 'blitzkrieg' warfare and combined operations techniques, the offensive ended the Phony War and sent the French forces reeling as their government fled from occupied Paris. For the Axis, it was a dramatic victory. But how was this spectacular result possible? In To Lose a Battle Alistair Horne tells the day-by-day, moment-by-moment story of the battle, sifted from the vast Nazi archives and the fragmentary records of the beaten Allies. Using eye-witness accounts of battle operations and personal memoirs of leading figures on both sides, this book steps far beyond the confines of military accounts to form a major contribution to our understanding of this important period in European history. 'Alistair Horne really brings home the pathos and human folly of war, and he writes brilliantly' The Times 'Horne follows his line unfalteringly. All the details are there: the small, fleeting triumphs, the greater disasters, the bravery, the cowardice, the stupidity and the intelligence ... that make war so fascinating and so terrible' Economist 'Horne completes his masterly trilogy ... the definitive account of one of the most efficient and astonishing campaigns of all time' The Times Literary Supplement One of Britain's greatest historians, Sir Alistair Horne, CBE, is the author of a trilogy on the rivalry between France and Germany, The Price of Glory, The Fall of Paris and To Lose a Battle, as well as a two-volume life of Harold Macmillan.\",['Alistair Horne'],Penguin,2007-11-27\n",

Indeed, it may come as a surprise to learn that animals were a central inspiration to the development of moving pictures themselves. In Animals in Film, Jonathan Burt points out that the mobility of animals presented technical and conceptual challenges to early film-makers, the solutions of which were an important factor in advancing photographic technology, accelerating the speed of both film and camera. The early filming of animals also marked one of the most significant and far-reaching changes in the history of animal representation, and has largely determined the way animals have been visualized in the twentieth century. Burt looks at the extraordinary relation-ship between animals, cinema and photography (including the pioneering work of Eadweard Muybridge and Jules-Etienne Marey) and the technological developments and challenges posed by the animal as a specific kind of moving object. Animals in Film is a shrewd account of the politics of animals in cinema, of how movies and video have developed as weapons for animal rights activists, and of the roles that animals have played in film, from the avant-garde to Hollywood.\",['Jonathan Burt'],Reaktion Books,2004-02-03\n",

The god of Open theism, on the other hand, is ready to enter into new experiences and to become deeply involved in helping us cope as we, with him, face things we simply did not know would happen. They insist that God has knowledge, but not all knowledge, certainly not knowledge of the future acts of free beings. Such Open theistic inferences reveal a deep-seated devotion to Enlightenment categories and narrow, unpoetic imaginations. Ideas have destinations, and one of the consequences of our trying to read the Scriptures without any poetry in our souls will be the eventual destruction of any possibility of ministering to souls. Just imagine the hymn writer trying to lift up the downcast - \"\"I know not what the future holds, but I know Who doesn't know much about it either.\"\"\",['Douglas Wilson'],Canon Press &amp, Book Service,2001\n",

A spiritual mine of breadth and depth with valuable information and knowledge - a document of toiling and moiling, going back to the very beginning of the mining profession, \"\"a calling of peculiar dignity\"\", as the \"\"Father of Mineralogy\"\", Georgius Agricola, expressed it. Besides great scholars and famous men, the \"\"unknown miner,\"\" the unsung hero of mining, and simple mining workmen are remembered in the same degree of respect and appreciation. Many of the poets, laborers, musicians, pastors, engineers, painters, physicians, entrepreneurs, and \"\"torch-bearers of mankind\"\" were inspired by mining. As the Journal of the United Mine Workers of America, Washington, D.C., December 15, 1971, states in its review about MINING LORE...: \"\"...The author, Wolfgang Paul... a mining engineer... takes the reader from prehistoric times to the present. ...\"\" To this day the \"\"spirit of mining\"\", its rich traditions and cultural elements are generally unknown. Hence, this book has been published as a testimonial - an indispensable resource not only with respect to mining, but also to the humanities, religion, ethnography, anthropology and the arts in the broadest sense. The American mining engineer and jurist, Professor Koehler S. Stout, Chairman, Engineering Division, Montana College of Mineral Science and Technology, Butte, Mt., sums it up this way, \"\"MINING LORE..., a monumental document on miners' contribution to mankind, and, at the same time, 'a monument of personal achievement.'\"\"\",['Wolfgang Paul'],,1970\n",

      "Removed line: The Rise of the West,: A History of the Human Community,\"The Rise of the West, winner of the National Book Award for history in 1964, is famous for its ambitious scope and intellectual rigor. In it, McNeill challenges the Spengler-Toynbee view that a number of separate civilizations pursued essentially independent careers, and argues instead that human cultures interacted at every stage of their history. The author suggests that from the Neolithic beginnings of grain agriculture to the present major social changes in all parts of the world were triggered by new or newly important foreign stimuli, and he presents a persuasive narrative of world history to support this claim. In a retrospective essay titled \"\"The Rise of the West after Twenty-five Years,\"\" McNeill shows how his book was shaped by the time and place in which it was written (1954-63). He discusses how historiography subsequently developed and suggests how his portrait of the world's past in The Rise of the West should be revised to reflect these changes. \"\"This is not only the most learned and the most intelligent, it is also the most stimulating and fascinating book that has ever set out to recount and explain the whole history of mankind. . . .

      "Removed line: Threatening Anthropology: McCarthyism and the FBI&rsquo,s Surveillance of Activist Anthropologists,\"A vital reminder of the importance of academic freedom, Threatening Anthropology offers a meticulously detailed account of how U.S. Cold War surveillance damaged the field of anthropology. David H. Price reveals how dozens of activist anthropologists were publicly and privately persecuted during the Red Scares of the 1940s and 1950s. He shows that it was not Communist Party membership or Marxist beliefs that attracted the most intense scrutiny from the fbi and congressional committees but rather social activism, particularly for racial justice. Demonstrating that the fbi's focus on anthropologists lessened as activist work and Marxist analysis in the field tapered off, Price argues that the impact of McCarthyism on anthropology extended far beyond the lives of those who lost their jobs. Its messages of fear and censorship had a pervasive chilling effect on anthropological investigation. As critiques that might attract government attention were abandoned, scholarship was curtailed. Price draws on extensive archival research including correspondence, oral histories, published sources, court hearings, and more than 30,000 pages of fbi and government memorandums released to him under the Freedom of Information Act. He describes government monitoring of activism and leftist thought on college campuses, the surveillance of specific anthropologists, and the disturbing failure of the academic community-including the American Anthropological Association-to challenge the witch hunts. Today the \"\"war on terror\"\" is invoked to license the government's renewed monitoring of academic work, and it is increasingly difficult for researchers to access government documents, as Price reveals in the appendix describing his wrangling with Freedom of Information Act requests. A disquieting chronicle of censorship and its consequences in the past, Threatening Anthropology is an impassioned cautionary tale for the present.\",['David H.

      "Removed line: The Education of Henry Adams, An Autobiography,\"The Education of Henry Adams follows the life of presidential descendent Henry Adams. However, instead of serving just as an account of Adams' deeds, The Education of Henry Adams is a series of observations and introspections Adams makes on social changes, scientific advancements, personal relationships, professional success, travel, religion, war, and education. Born into the privilege of wealth and the renowned success of his ancestors, President John Adams and President John Quincy Adams, Adams received an education from notable schools, such as Harvard. He continued his prestigious education in Berlin, studying law and the German language. Despite his formal education, Adams felt unprepared to face the changing dynamics of his country, including shifts in social, religious, political, and scientific beliefs. For this reason, Adams advocates for \"\"self-education\"\" through experience, friendships, and reading. In his autobiography, Adams endorses studying American history and science in school, and encourages the process of self-educating after one's formal education. With a set of strong political and religious beliefs, Adams invokes a substantial impression with his perspectives on the on-going transformation of the United States of America. Henry Adams' autobiography, The Education of Henry Adams, has earned remarkable acclaim, including receiving a Pulitzer Prize. As a man who had direct access to many American political offices, including the presidential cabinet, the senate, and the congress, Adams had an intimate view of the innerworkings of American politics, and lived through social changes such as the Civil War, the abolition of slavery, scientific advancements, shifts in religious views, and the first World War. Though he felt his formal education left him unprepared for such happenings, Adams encourages readers to learn from their experiences and relationships. The Education of Henry Adams offers invaluable insight on the rapid changes in society, and reminds readers that one's education is never finished. Now with a new, eye-catching cover design and reprinted in a modern font, The Education of Henry Adams by Henry Adams is more accessible than ever and able to offer modern-day readers insight on historical events and philosophy of learning that will always be relevant.\",['Henry Adams'],Graphic Arts Books,2020-12-01\n",

      "Removed line: Nothing Happens: Chantal Akerman&rsquo,s Hyperrealist Everyday,\"Through films that alternate between containment, order, and symmetry on the one hand, and obsession, explosiveness, and a lack of control on the other, Chantal Akerman has gained a reputation as one of the most significant filmmakers working today. Her 1975 film Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles is widely regarded as the most important feminist film of that decade. In Nothing Happens, Ivone Margulies presents the first comprehensive study of this influential avant-garde Belgian filmmaker. Margulies grounds her critical analysis in detailed discussions of Akerman's work--from Saute ma ville, a 13-minute black-and-white film made in 1968, through Jeanne Dielman and Je tu il elle to the present. Focusing on the real-time representation of a woman's everyday experience in Jeanne Dielman, Margulies brings the history of social and progressive realism and the filmmaker's work into perspective. Pursuing two different but related lines of inquiry, she investigates an interest in the everyday that stretches from postwar neorealist cinema to the feminist rewriting of women's history in the seventies. She then shows how Akerman's \"\"corporeal cinema\"\" is informed by both American experiments with performance and duration and the layerings present in works by European modernists Bresson, Rohmer, and Dreyer. This analysis revises the tired opposition between realism and modernism in the cinema, defines Akerman's minimal-hyperrealist aesthetics in contrast to Godard's anti-illusionism, and reveals the inadequacies of popular characterizations of Akerman's films as either simply modernist or feminist. An essential book for students of Chantal Akerman's work, Nothing Happens will also interest international film critics and scholars, filmmakers, art historians, and all readers concerned with feminist film theory.\",['Ivone Margulies'],Duke University Press,1996\n",

The first rocket will take five minutes to hit London. You have six minutes to stop the second. Rudi Graf is an engineer who always dreamed of sending rockets to the moon. But instead, he finds himself working alongside Wernher von Braun, launching V2 rockets at London for the Nazis from a bleak seaside town in occupied Holland. As the SS increases its scrutiny on the project, Graf, an engineer more than a soldier, has to muster all of his willpower to toe the party line. And when rumors of a defector circulate through the German ranks, Graf becomes a prime suspect. Meanwhile, Kay Caton-Walsh, a young English intelligence officer, is living through the turmoil of war. After she and her lover, an RAF officer, are caught in a V2 attack, she volunteers to ship out for newly liberated Belgium. Armed with little more than a slide rule and a few equations, Kay and her colleagues hope to locate and destroy the launch sites. But at this stage in the war it's hard to know who, if anyone, she can trust. As the death toll soars, these twin stories play out against the background of the German missile campaign during the Second World War. And what the reader comes to understand is that Kay's and Graf's destinies are on a collision course.\",['Robert Harris'],Vintage,2020-11-17\n",

He had been on the warpath against whites and other Indians for more than a decade when he fought the greatest battle of his life. On the afternoon of June 25, 1876, five troops of the U. S. Seventh Cavalry under the command of George Armstrong Custer rode into the valley of the Little Big Horn River, confidently expecting to rout the Indian encampments there. Instead, the cavalry met the gathered strength of Sioux and Cheyenne warriors, who did not run as expected but turned the battle toward the soldiers. White Bull charged again and again, fighting until the last soldier was dead. The battle was Custer's Last Stand, and white Bull was later referred to as the warrior who killed Custer In 1932 White Bull related his life story to Stanley Vestal, who corroborated the details, from other sources and prepared this biography. \"\"All that I told him is straight and true,\"\" said White Bull.

      "Removed line: German Catholics and Hitler's wars,: A study in social control,\"Prior to the outbreak of World War II, nearly forty thousand German Catholics were involved in the German Catholic Peace League, a movement that caused many people in various countries to seriously reconsider the dimension of pacifism in their faith. During the course of the War, however, many of these same German Catholics raised no serious objection to serving in Germany's armies or swearing allegiance to Adolph Hitler. First published in 1962, German Catholics and Hitler's Wars created a furor, ultimately causing a serious reevaluation of church-state relationships and, in particular, of the morality of war. This work began as an attempt to understand the demise of the German Catholic Peace League. But because of various factors, including the destruction of vital records, Gordon C. Zahn began to consider the behavior of German Catholics in general and the evidence of their almost total conformity to the war demands of the Nazi regime. Using sociological analysis, he argues convincingly for the existence of a super-effective system of social controls, and of a selection between the competing values of Catholicism and nationalism. Although Zahn never speculates, conclusions are inescapable, chief among them that the traditional Catholic doctrine of the \"\"just war\"\" has ceased to be operative for Catholics in the modern world.\",['Gordon C.

      "Removed line: HRISANTHI&apos,S LEGACY,\"\"\"HRISANTHI's LEGACY' \"\"Hrisanthi's Legacy\"\" begins as a modern odyssey, the story of a determined woman in an isolated village in Turkish-occupied Crete, with limited personal resources but imbued with courage and vision. She dreamed of a safe life and a brighter future for her children. She was born during the time when the people of Crete lived under the yoke of their Ottoman oppressors, deprived of churches and schools and struggling for day-to-day survival, yet there was hope in her heart of an existence beyond the narrow confines of her small, repressed world. Against all odds, she set her sights on a haven of freedom where opportunity abounded. It was a lofty ambition for a simple, uneducated woman with no real knowledge of what lay beyond the outskirts of her village, but she was undeterred. Responsibility became her companion early in life. The eldest of seven brothers and sisters, she became their substitute mother at the age of twelve when her own mother died in childbirth. For the next seven years, she honed the skills that would serve her well in the pursuit of her dream. She was nineteen when her father arranged her marriage to Manoli Drakakis, a man she had met only once, and her own family began. She gave birth to nine children but only four survived daughters, Erene, Maria and Catina; and a son, Leftheri. Erene died in Crete; the others accompanied Hrisanthi on her odyssey. Their journey began when they left the village under the cloak of darkness and made their way to Herakleion, where they boarded the ship that took them to safety in Piraeus, the port of Athens. There Hrisanthi, as a cook and housekeeper for a wealthy Greek family, and Manoli as a marble cutter, earned the money that took them to the next stop on their voyage Alexandria, Egypt. They knew neither the customs nor the language, yet they managed to survive. Settled in Alexandria, Hrisanthi began to look toward more distant horizons, and America became her ultimate goal. World War I raged in the north Atlantic, forcing the family to look toward a safer passage. Buenos Aires, where other Greeks had settled and work could be found, now became their destination. It was from there that they pointed themselves toward the United States, where liberty and opportunity beckoned on the distant horizon. Leftheri had preceded them and was a copper miner in Butte, Montana, where they would join him. Manoli and Maria left first, to be followed as money became available, by Hrisanthi and Catina. Arriving at Angel Island, the port of entry near San Francisco, they boarded the train for Butte. Instead of the fabled gold in the streets, the newcomers found a hardscrabble city with no airs or pretensions, where tough copper miners risked their lives as they descended into the bowels of the earth for the dollars that supported them and their families. Others, equally tough, worked on the railroads that filled the air on the Eastside where Leftheri lived with never-ending smoke and noise. She had looked upon America as paradise. Now Maria wrote to her mother and sister in Buenos Aires, \"\"This isn't heaven. It's hell.\"\" Her brother, Leftheri, known to his friends as Ellos, forced Maria into an arranged marriage to his best friend, Peter Pappas, a man she barely knew, who was fifteen years her senior. At first, Maria adamantly refused. She gave in when Leftheri threatened to leave and never return. Shortly after the wedding, he left. Maria, our mother, settled with her husband, Pete, in a little red brick house located in between three sets of railroad tracks and under the ominous shadow of the Belmont mine and its ore bin. It was a place of dirt roads, paths filled with ruts, humble homes, some with outhouses, and few amenities. There she gave birth to my sister, Julie; my brother, Dallas, and me, inheritors of the legacy our Greek grandmother, Hrisanthi, made possible for us. It was a starting point for an immigrant experience unknown to those who settle\",['Irene Pappas'],,2006-01\n",

Miraculously preserved on clay tablets dating back as much as four thousand years, the poem of Gilgamesh, king of Uruk, is the world's oldest epic, predating Homer by many centuries. The story tells of Gilgamesh's adventures with the wild man Enkidu, and of his arduous journey to the ends of the earth in quest of the Babylonian Noah and the secret of immortality. Alongside its themes of family, friendship and the duties of kings, The Epic of Gilgamesh is, above all, about mankind's eternal struggle with the fear of death. The Babylonian version has been known for over a century, but linguists are still deciphering new fragments in Akkadian and Sumerian. Andrew George's gripping translation brilliantly combines these into a fluid narrative and will long rank as the definitive English Gilgamesh.

      "Removed line: Heresies exposed,: A brief critical examination in the light of the Holy Scriptures of some of the prevailing heresies and false teachings of today,\"The great prophecies contained in the Olivet Discourse were uttered by the Lord prior to His crucifixion on Calvary. As He sat on the Mount of Olives, where in the future His feet shall stand in the day of His manifestation, He prophesied concerning the destruction of the magnificent temple building, and His disciples questioned Him, saying, \"\"'Tell us when shall these things be? And what shall be the sign of Thy coming and of the end of the age?\"\" (Matt. 24:3, R. V., margin). In answer to their questions, the Lord, looking through the years to the consummation of the age, pointed out certain unmistakable signs by which believers were to know when the age was drawing to a close. He saw kingdom rising against kingdom, and nation against nation. He heard the sound of war and rumors of war. He saw pestilence and earthquake, Bolshevism, Communism, anarchy, lawlessness. He saw a time of trouble, the like of which has not yet been known, a time which He called \"\"the great tribulation.\"\" He spoke plainly concerning these matters in order that the believers in every age might be fully instructed. Among these conditions and events the Lord warned His disciples concerning the religious conditions that would prevail in the end time. \"\"False Christs, and false prophets, shall arise,\"\" He declared. So great will be their delusions at that time that \"\"if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.\"\" The Holy Spirit, coming on the day of Pentecost, heralded through Paul, Peter, James, and John, and the other inspired writers, the same warning, making it known that toward the end of the age the great foundational truths of the gospel will be denied. The word \"\"Denial\"\" will characterize the religious condition of Christendom when those closing days become reality. The days in which you and I are living are days in which Christians need to know their Bibles, for the only way by which we may know whether or not a system of teaching is of God is by viewing the system through the lens of Holy Writ--reading the system in the light of the Bible and not reading the Bible in the light of the system. Because of the crying need of Biblical light on these erroneous teachings, I gave a series of addresses in the Church of the Open Door, on \"\"The Cult Kingdom,\"\" selecting ten of the most damaging heresies for discussion. When people saw them revealed in the searchlight of God's Word a large number of men and women, held in their grip, were mercifully delivered. This created a wide-spread interest among God's children, culminating in a demand for the printing of these addresses so that others, caught in the meshes of false doctrine, might also find freedom. I was about to comply with this request when I discovered a book compiled by William C. Irvine, called \"\"HERESIES EXPOSED.\"\" This book completely covers not only the ten cults I exposed, but many others, so instead of publishing my addresses I have arranged with the writer to allow me to print this special edition of his excellent work. By so doing we meet the demand of friends for this material and provide my radio audience with another valuable book.\",\"['H.

So when Joe sees a little white goat amidst the singing birds, salted herrings and hokey-pokey ices of a Whitechapel market he has to have him.

For in the embattled working-class community of 1950s East End London, there are plenty of people in need of good fortune.

      "Removed line: The semisovereign people,: A realist's view of democracy in America,\"This book started out to be an attempt to formulate a theory of political organization. While the emphasis has shifted somewhat in the course of the writing, it is still a book about political organization, an attempt to work out a theory about the relation between organization and conflict, the relation between political organization and democracy, and the organizational alternatives open to the American people. The assumption made throughout is that the nature of political organization depends on the conflicts exploited in the political system, which ultimately is what politics is about. The thesis is that we shall never understand politics unless we know what the struggle is about. The great problem in American politics is: What makes things happen? We might understand the dynamics of American politics if we knew what is going on when things are happening. What is the process of change? What does change look like? These questions are worth asking because obviously tremendous things are going on in American public affairs, even in quiet times... To understand why Americans generally have been unconscious of the process of change it is necessary to take a new look at the dynamics of American politics. Throughout this book the emphasis has been on the dynamic character of the American political system. The concepts formulated here constitute an attack on all political theories, all research techniques and concepts tending to show that American politics is a meaningless stalemate about which no one can do anything. Because so much is going on, one object of the book is to show the need for a new public policy about politics.--from the Preface.\",['Elmer Eric Schattschneider'],Wadsworth Publishing Company,1975\n",

And then, abruptly, in 2011's acclaimed Congress of the Animals(the second Woodring original graphic novel, following Weathercraft) Frank did leave the Unifactor for uncharted lands beyond-where, after a string of trials, he acquired a soulmate named Fran. This development raised far more questions than it answered. Would Frank become placid and domesticated? Would he be jilted? Would he turn out to be a dreadful cad? Would he become a downtrodden and exhausted paterfamilias staring vacantly into the dimming fire of life as obnoxious grandchildren pulled his peglike ears and stole his porridge? The answers to these fruitless speculations and many more are delivered in a devastatingly unpredictable fashion in Fran, which is in effect part two of Congress of the Animals.

In March and April 1942, more explosives were dropped on the tiny Mediterranean island of Malta - smaller than the Isle of Wight - than on the whole of Britain during the first year of the Blitz. Malta had become one of the most strategically important places in the world. From there, the Allies could attack Axis supply lines to North Africa; without it, Rommel would be able to march unchecked into Egypt, Suez and the Middle East. For the Allies this would have been catastrophic. As Churchill said, Malta had to be held 'at all costs'. FORTRESS MALTA follows the story through the eyes of those who were there: young men such as twenty-year-old fighter pilot Raoul Daddo-Langlois, anti-aircraft gunner Ken Griffiths, American Art Roscoe and submariner Tubby Crawford - who served on the most successful Allied submarine of the Second World War; cabaret dancer-turned RAF plotter Christina Ratcliffe, and her lover, the brilliant and irrepressible reconnaissance pilot, Adrian Warburton.

Join the Random House Reader's Circle for author chats and more. In boyhood, Louis Zamperini was an incorrigible delinquent. As a teenager, he channeled his defiance into running, discovering a prodigious talent that had carried him to the Berlin Olympics. But when World War II began, the athlete became an airman, embarking on a journey that led to a doomed flight on a May afternoon in 1943. When his Army Air Forces bomber crashed into the Pacific Ocean, against all odds, Zamperini survived, adrift on a foundering life raft. Ahead of Zamperini lay thousands of miles of open ocean, leaping sharks, thirst and starvation, enemy aircraft, and, beyond, a trial even greater. Driven to the limits of endurance, Zamperini would answer desperation with ingenuity; suffering with hope, resolve, and humor; brutality with rebellion. His fate, whether triumph or tragedy, would be suspended on the fraying wire of his will.

      "Removed line: Teddy Roosevelt at San Juan: The Making of a President (Williams-Ford Texas A&M, University Military History Series),\"Termed a \"\"Southern gothic musical,\"\" Ghost Brothers of Darkland County was scripted by novelist Stephen King with the music coming from maverick heartland rocker John Mellencamp, a collaboration a bit left-field for both artists. This set includes Mellencamp's songs interspersed with key dialogue from King's libretto, and while the story might be too complex -- essentially, it's the tale of two brothers involved in a murder/suicide whose ghosts haunt an isolated cabin and whose tragic deeds and consequent fate seems about to be repeated by their living nephews -- to be truly appreciated in single-disc form like this, so it's Mellencamp's songs, sung by the likes of Elvis Costello, Neko Case, Sheryl Crow, Dave and Phil Alvin (real-life brothers whose estrangement with each other ended while working on this project), Taj Mahal, Ryan Bingham, Clyde Mulroney, Rosanne Cash, and Kris Kristofferson (Mellencamp only sings on one song here, the summing-it-up last track \"\"Truth\"\") that are really left to carry things. They certainly work as songs, and may well be among the best Mellencamp has ever written, while the overall sound of the whole musical suite, crafted by T-Bone Burnett, is kind of like a sparse and shined-up version of a late-period Tom Waits album, due in part to the presence of multi-instrumentalist Marc Ribot on most of the tracks, and the tight, spare rhythm section of Jay Bellerose on drums and David Piltch on bass. The performances? Elvis Costello sounds gleeful and sinful on \"\"That's Me\"\" (identity and fulfillment are key themes of Ghost Brothers of Darkland Country, that and history's tendency to repeat itself), Neko Case is sassy and sure on \"\"That's Who I Am,\"\" Kris Kristofferson sounds old, wise, and weary on \"\"How Many Days,\"\" Taj Mahal rages through \"\"Tear This Cabin Down,\"\" and Sheryl Crow is confident and cocky on \"\"Jukin',\"\" while Rosanne Cash turns in a delicately worn and wise reading of \"\"You Don't Know Me,\"\" and for a story that spans decades and generations, it's obvious that everyone is singing about who they are, who they ought to be, and who they ended up becoming. It's difficult to say how good this musical is just from the songs and pieces of dialogue presented here, but the songs have a weary, inevitable flow to them, as if fate forced them into a dark room with little light or air or chance of redemption. Redemption comes with acceptance of who one is, the songs and story here seem to say, and only then can the real truth about what has happened to anyone really be revealed. It's a ghost story, after all. ~ Steve Leggett\",\"['Peggy Samuels', 'Harold Samuels']\",Texas A&M University Press,1997\n",

These are the questions Roland Barthes addresses in Writing Degree Zero, his first published book and a landmark in his oeuvre. The debate had engaged the European literary community since the 1930s; with this fierce manifesto, Barthes challenged the notion of literature's obligation to be socially committed. Yes, Barthes allows, the writer has a political and ethical responsibility. But the history of French literature shows that the writer has often failed to meet it--and from Barthes's perspective, literature is committed to little more than the myth of itself. Expert and uncompromising, Writing Degree Zero introduced the themes that would soon establish Barthes as one of the leading voices in literary criticism.\",['Roland Barthes'],Hill and Wang,2012-03-13\n",

He and his friends Taffy and the Laird share a studio in a Quartier Latin neighborhood full of artists and musicians, including a German-Polish music teacher named Svengali. The group become acquainted with an artists' model named Trilby, who was orphaned as a child and who works to support her little brother and herself. Trilby is lively, charming, unpretentious, and beautiful, and soon Little Billee is madly in love. When his mother learns that Little Billee intends to marry an artists' model (nude models were almost as socially unacceptable as protitutes) she travels to Paris and tells Trilby that such a marriage would mean ruin for Billee and his family. Trilby promises that she will never see Little Billee again. Soon afterward, Trilby vanishes, leaving Billee sick and distraught. Many years later, Billee and his friends hear of a singer called \"\"La Svengali\"\" who has astonished all of Europe. By attending one of her performances, they learn that \"\"La Svengali\"\" is the wife of the music teacher they knew in the Quartier Latin, trained by him to sing with more technical mastery than anyone has ever heard. When \"\"La Svengali\"\" appears on stage, they see that she is none other than Trilby. Her singing moves the audience to tears, though everyone notices that she moves stiffly and strangely and that her face is as blank as an automaton's. Not until Svengali dies suddenly during a concert is Trilby set free from the hypnotic spell that has controlled her for years.\"\"\"\"--Allreaders.com.\",['George Du Maurier'],New York : Harper , Montreal : W.F.

      "Removed line: A Rain of Darts, The Mexican Aztecs: The Mexican Aztecs (Texas Pan-American Series),\"This book was the first serious scholarly attempt in nearly a century to put in narrative form the exciting and important history of the Mexican Indians who founded Tenochtitlan and who created from it what is known as the Aztec empire. Although many native sources, often in translations with scholarly annotations. became available in the twentieth century, the corpus of this material was scattered and uncoordinated. Burr Cartwright Brundage has utilized these sources to produce a consecutive narrative that portrays direction and purpose in the evolution of the Aztec empire. A Rain of Darts is the first one-volume history of the Mexica, historically the most important of the Aztec peoples. The focus of the narrative is on the political state produced by the Mexica during their stormy history. The eleven Mexica reigns that preceded the Spanish Conquest are investigated, their triumphs and errors explained, and the lives of their great leaders illuminated where the sources allow. The narrative opens with the first appearance of the Mexica out of the arid north; it details their aimless wandering, the founding of the city of Mexico in the waters of Lake Tezcoco, their desperate struggle for independence (successfully achieved in 1428), and the flourishing of the new state and its curiously structured empire. This history concludes with an analysis of the character of Moteuczoma II, and investigates the final sickness of the Mexican state. Cortez and his small army of Spaniards are seen here for the first time in historical literature through the eyes of the people they conquered. The Mexica Aztecs remain at the center of the narrative. The Mexica were unable to build a tightly knit empire because of the elitist, international warrior class and its peculiar cult of war and sacrifice. To the Mexica, warfare and bloodshed were sacraments; the teuctli or knightly warrior was the priest of this cult. to which he was as loyal as to the state. In this lay the uniqueness of the Mexican state and the seeds of its tragic end in 1521.\",['Burr Cartwright Brundage'],University of Texas Press,2012-03-21\n",

It begins by presenting key interpretive gaps in the biblical text concerning Job and his wife, explaining the way gender studies offers guiding principles with which the author engages a reception history of their marriage. After analyzing Job and his wife within medieval Christian theology of Eden, the author identifies ways in which Job's wife visually aligns with medieval images of Satan. The volume explores portrayals of Job and his wife in publications on marriage and gender roles in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, moving onto an investigation of William Blake's sharp artistic divergence from the common tradition in his representation of Job's wife as a shrew. In the exploration of societal portrayals of Job and his Wife throughout history, this book discovers how arguments about marriage intertwine with not only gender roles, but also, with political, social, and historical movements.\",['Katherine Low'],A&amp,C Black,2013-08-29\n",

Joshua Chamberlain The fascinating story of Joshua Chamberlain and his volunteer regiment, the Twentieth Maine, is reprinted with a new foreword by Civil War historian and UCLA professor Joan Waugh. Pullen's classic and highly acclaimed book tells how Chamberlain and his men fought at Antietam, Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville on their way to the pivotal battle of Gettysburg. There, on July 2, 1863, at Little Round Top, they heroically saved the left flank of the Union battle line. The Twentieth Maine's remarkable story ends with the surrender of Lee's troops at Appomattox.

      "Removed line: The Telephone Book: AT&T, Guide to Installing Telephones & Accessories,\"The telephone marks the place of an absence. Affiliated with discontinuity, alarm, and silence, it raises fundamental questions about the constitution of self and other, the stability of location, systems of transfer, and the destination of speech. Profoundly changing our concept of long-distance, it is constantly transmitting effects of real and evocative power. To the extent that it always relates us to the absent other, the telephone, and the massive switchboard attending it, plugs into a hermeneutics of mourning. The Telephone Book, itself organized by a \"\"telephonic logic,\"\" fields calls from philosophy, history, literature, and psychoanalysis. It installs a switchboard that hooks up diverse types of knowledge while rerouting and jamming the codes of the disciplines in daring ways. Avital Ronell has done nothing less than consider the impact of the telephone on modern thought. Her highly original, multifaceted inquiry into the nature of communication in a technological age will excite everyone who listens in. The book begins by calling close attention to the importance of the telephone in Nazi organization and propaganda, with special regard to the philosophy of Martin Heidegger. In the Third Reich the telephone became a weapon, a means of state surveillance, \"\"an open accomplice to lies.\"\" Heidegger, in Being and Time and elsewhere, elaborates on the significance of \"\"the call.\"\" In a tour de force response, Ronell mobilizes the history and terminology of the telephone to explicate his difficult philosophy. Ronell also speaks of the appearance of the telephone in the literary works of Duras, Joyce, Kafka, Rilke, and Strindberg. She examines its role in psychoanalysis-Freud said that the unconscious is structured like a telephone, and Jung and R. D. Laing saw it as a powerful new body part. She traces its historical development from Bell's famous first call: \"\"Watson, come here!\"\" Thomas A. Watson, his assistant, who used to communicate with spirits, was eager to get the telephone to talk, and thus to link technology with phantoms and phantasms. In many ways a meditation on the technologically constituted state, The Telephone Book opens a new field, becoming the first political deconstruction of technology, state terrorism, and schizophrenia. And it offers a fresh reading of the American and European addiction to technology in which the telephone emerges as the crucial figure of this age.\",['Avital Ronell'],U of Nebraska Press,1989-01-01\n",

Miss Marple encounters a compelling murder mystery in the sleepy little village of St. Mary Mead, where under the seemingly peaceful exterior of an English country village lurks intrigue, guilt, deception and death. Colonel Protheroe, local magistrate and overbearing land-owner is the most detested man in the village. Everyone--even in the vicar--wishes he were dead.

A full-length recounting of Puccini's fascinating life, rich in previously unused materials, is followed by detailed analyses of each of his operas and other compositions. The author, a Viennese conductor and musicologist, has performed this monumental task with knowledge, grace, and insight. The biography brings to life a curious, somewhat ambiguous man whose greatly successful career was marked alternately by storms, tragedies, and triumphs, a genius who somehow missed the final greatness. His relations with his family, colleagues, librettists, singers, conductors--and his peculiar, convoluted relationship with his wife--have some of the very drama that has made his operas so enduringly popular. Puccini's letters are quoted extensively, many of them in English for the first time. The opera analyses, constantly evaluating the music in terms of drama and libretto, are unique in musical literature and in their completeness and illumination. They are, furthermore, judicious and soundly musical, for instead of accepting ready-made opinions (many of which are quoted), they go directly to the scores themselves.\",['Mosco Carner'],,1959\n",

The authors offer multipurpose solutions to the sustainability challenge that integrate industrial development, employment, technology, environment, national and international law, trade, finance, and public and worker health and safety. The authors present a compelling wake-up call that warns of the collision course set between the current paths of continued growth and inevitable unsustainability in the world today. Offering clear examples and real solutions, this textbook illustrates how the driving forces that are currently promoting unsustainability can be refocused and redesigned to reverse course and improve the state of the world.

In a small rural town outside Seattle, Joanna, an Ethiopian girl adopted by a white fundamentalist Christian family, is found dead of hypothermia in her own backyard--setting in motion a gripping journey into the complexities of human emotion. How does it feel to be a child taken into a family that doesn't share her background, her religion, or the color of her skin? What does it mean to be a mother on trial for murder? And why would a lawyer choose to defend such a woman? Royal is a criminal attorney in his eighties, and this is his final case. His son, our narrator, drives Royal every day from his office to the town where the tragedy took place, and observes the trial as it unfolds. The consequences will reach beyond what he could have anticipated. Bracing, astute, and intensely imagined, The Final Case is a tightrope walk of a novel, a deeply affecting work of fiction that dares to confront life's most irreconcilable moral quandaries.

      "Removed line: On Reflection, an Autobiography,\"In addressing her grandchildren in the foreword to this autobiography, Helen Hayes writes: 'It is no longer fashionable to have faith; but your grandmother has never been famous for her chic.' It is, in fact, because of her tenacious faith in the world that Helen Hayes decided to write this book as a legacy for her grandchildren; to be read one day when they are grown. In setting down all the family stories, the backstage anecdotes and her recollections of spiritual struggle, she has produced a legacy for all of us. After years of unwillingness to discuss her private world-which even her bestselling book A Gift of Joy did not do-she has looked beyond her legend and directly at life's lessons as she was forced to learn them. Deeply moving and affectionately witty, her autobiography is an affirmation of the faith that first gave it impetus. All the Helens are here: the 'unrehearsed' child and her shy but ambitious mother; the young actress who so appealed to such luminaries as John Drew and William Gillette; the young woman who forged a marriage with a brilliant renegade named Charles MacArthur; the mother of Mary and Jim; the keeper of an endless procession of hilariously tyrannical poodles; the friend of Fitzgerald, Harpo Marx and Dietrich; the lady who became out 'First Lady of the Theater'; the mature woman, looking forward; and still, and always, the actress.

Why does the U.S. seem to support foreign dictators? Why has it invested so many of its resources in stockpiling nuclear arms? Why doesn't the U.S. act as a force for peace throughout the world? In this probing, provocative analysis, Michael Parenti reveals the hidden agenda of American foreign policy decsisions. No matter which party is in power, the U.S. acts to protect the interests of large American-based corporations, in order to maintain valuable overseas markets and cheap foreign labor. In lucid detail, Michael Parenti examines just how these very private interests determine America's public policy goals, from the impoverishment of developing nations to the building of an intimidating nuclear arsenal. What he discovers will surely be controversial and suggests that the greatest threats to democracy-both here and abroad-may emanate from within the United States itself.\",['Michael J.

Turchin argues that the key to the formation of an empire is a society's capacity for collective action. He demonstrates that high levels of cooperation are found where people have to band together to fight off a common enemy, and that this kind of cooperation led to the formation of the Roman and Russian empires, and the United States. But as empires grow, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, conflict replaces cooperation, and dissolution inevitably follows. Eloquently argued and rich with historical examples, War and Peace and War offers a bold new theory about the course of world history with implications for nations today.\",['Peter Turchin'],Penguin,2007-02-27\n",

While regarded by foreigners and the Moroccan government as a brigand, some Moroccans considered him a heroic figure, fighting a repressive, corrupt government, while others considered him a thief. Historian David S. Woolman referred to Raisuni as \"\"a combination Robin Hood, feudal baron and tyrannical bandit.\"\" He was considered by many as \"\"The last of the Barbary Pirates\"\". Mulai Ahmed er Raisuni was born ... in the late 1860s ... Due to this and his reportedly handsome visage, one of his other nicknames was \"\"the Eagle of Zinat.\"\" He was the son of a prominent Caid, and began following in his father's footsteps. However, Raisuni eventually drifted into crime, stealing cattle and sheep and earning the ire of Moroccan authorities. He was also widely known as a womanizer. By most accounts, the formative event in Raisuni's life was his arrest and imprisonment by Abd-el-Rahman Abd el-Saduk, the Pasha of Tangier, who was Raisuli's cousin and foster brother. The Pasha had invited Raisuni to dinner in his home in Tangier, only for his men to capture and brutalize Raisuni when he arrived. He was sent to the dungeon of Mogador and chained to a wall for four years; fortunately, his friends were allowed to bring him food, and he managed to survive. Raisuni was released from prison as a general clemency early in the reign of Sultan Abdelaziz - ironically, soon to become Raisuni's greatest enemy\"\"--Wikipedia.\",\"['Rosita Forbes', 'Rosita Torr Forbes']\",,1924\n",

      "Removed line: The green corn rebellion,: A novel,\"These days, rural Oklahoma is the last place anybody would look for leftist revolutionaries, but in 1917 the area exploded into full-blown insurrection. The state's tenant farmers, many of whom were Socialist Party members, viewed the Great War in Europe as a conflict that benefited only the rich. When the federal government enacted a draft, an uprising in eastern Oklahoma saw local townspeople skirmishing with rebellious farmers, including whites, blacks, and American Indians. More than 250 men were arrested - some sentenced for up to ten years' imprisonment. This is the backdrop of William Cunningham's powerful novel The Green Corn Rebellion. First published in 1935, it tells the story of Jim Tetley, who wants simply to be a good farmer - if the banks will only let him. As Jim copes with poverty, family rivalries, and community tensions, he must also weigh the need to respond to the call for armed rebellion. Although the insurrection itself succeeded only in undermining the socialist movement and fueling the Red Scare of the 1920s, Cunningham's incendiary writing has been compared to that of Erskine Caldwell. A uniquely American story with roots set deep in Oklahoma soil, The Green Corn Rebellion will attract all readers interested in the state's tumultuous history and in populist causes.\",['William Cunningham'],University of Oklahoma Press,2014-10-22\n",

Within decades after his death, his followers would call him God. Sifting through centuries of mythmaking, Reza Aslan sheds new light on one of history's most enigmatic figures by examining Jesus through the lens of the tumultuous era in which he lived. Balancing the Jesus of the Gospels against the historical sources, Aslan describes a man full of conviction and passion, yet rife with contradiction. He explores the reasons the early Christian church preferred to promulgate an image of Jesus as a peaceful spiritual teacher rather than a politically conscious revolutionary. And he grapples with the riddle of how Jesus understood himself, the mystery that is at the heart of all subsequent claims about his divinity. Zealot yields a fresh perspective on one of the greatest stories ever told even as it affirms the radical and transformative nature of Jesus' life and mission. Praise for Zealot \"\"Riveting . . . Aslan synthesizes Scripture and scholarship to create an original account.\"\"-The New Yorker \"\"Fascinatingly and convincingly drawn . . . Aslan may come as close as one can to respecting those who revere Jesus as the peace-loving, turn-the-other-cheek, true son of God depicted in modern Christianity, even as he knocks down that image.\"\"-The Seattle Times \"\"[Aslan's] literary talent is as essential to the effect of Zealot as are his scholarly and journalistic chops. . . .

      "Removed line: Race and the Education of Desire: Foucault&rsquo,s,\"Michel Foucault's History of Sexuality has been one of the most influential books of the last two decades. It has had an enormous impact on cultural studies and work across many disciplines on gender, sexuality, and the body. Bringing a new set of questions to this key work, Ann Laura Stoler examines volume one of History of Sexuality in an unexplored light. She asks why there has been such a muted engagement with this work among students of colonialism for whom issues of sexuality and power are so essential. Why is the colonial context absent from Foucault's history of a European sexual discourse that for him defined the bourgeois self? InRace and the Education of Desire, Stoler challenges Foucault's tunnel vision of the West and his marginalization of empire. She also argues that this first volume ofHistory of Sexuality contains a suggestive if not studied treatment of race. Drawing on Foucault's little-known 1976 College de France lectures, Stoler addresses his treatment of the relationship between biopower, bourgeois sexuality, and what he identified as \"\"racisms of the state.\"\" In this critical and historically grounded analysis based on cultural theory and her own extensive research in Dutch and French colonial archives, Stoler suggests how Foucault's insights have in the past constrained-and in the future may help shape-the ways we trace the genealogies of race. Race and the Education of Desire will revise current notions of the connections between European and colonial historiography and between the European bourgeois order and the colonial treatment of sexuality. Arguing that a history of European nineteenth-century sexuality must also be a history of race, it will change the way we think about Foucault.\",\"['Ann Laura Stoler', 'Willy Brandt Distinguished University Professor of Anthropology and Historical Studies Ann Laura Stoler']\",Duke University Press,1995\n",

Augustine of Hippo (354 430), theologian, priest, and bishop, is one of the most important figures in the development of Western Christianity. He is known as much for his long interior struggle that ended with conversion and baptism at age thirty-two as for his influential teachings on human will, original sin and the theology of just war. Cherished as a model for the pursuit of a life of spiritual grace and criticized for his theory of predestination, Augustine is recognized as a living expression of the passion to understand and communicate the deeper meanings of human experience. With fresh translations drawn from Augustine's voluminous writings and probing facing-page commentary, Augustinian scholar Joseph T. Kelley, PhD, provides insight into the mind and heart of this foundational Christian figure. Kelley illustrates how Augustine s keen intellect, rhetorical skill and passionate faith reshaped the theological language and dogmatic debates of early Christianity. He explores the stormy religious arguments and political upheavals of the fifth century, Augustine s controversial teachings on predestination, sexuality and marriage, and the deep undercurrents of Augustine s spiritual quest that still inspire Christians today.\"\"\",\"['Saint Augustine (Bishop of Hippo.)', 'Joseph T.

To be alive means, as Father Berrigan puts it, enduring the crisis of grace. The fruit of the gift of Christ to this world is an unequivocal and utterly vulnerable immersion in the world as it is. . . . It means living in such a way that life is welcomed as the extraordinary gift which life is and, then, honoring that gift by extravagance: by giving one's own life away. They call us dead men, and we live, wrote St. Paul. Berrigan's immersion into Pauline theology has allowed him to present his deepest concerns for the Church's role in the world.

      "Removed line: The twentieth century to Wittgenstein and Sartre,: A history of western phlilosophy (History of western philosophy),\"Most writings on Indian philosophy assume that its central concern is with moska, that the Vedas along with the Upanishadic texts are at its root and that it consists of six orthodox systems knowns as Mimamasa, Vedanta, Nyaya, Vaisesika, Samkhya, and Yoga, on the one hand and three unorthodox systems: Buddhism, Jainism and Carvaka, on the other. Besides these, they accept generally the theory of Karma and the theory of Purusartha as parts of what the Indian tradition thinks about human action. The essays in this volume question these assumptions and show that there is little ground for accepting them. A new counter-perspective is presented for the articulation of the Indian philosophical tradition that breaks from the traditional frame in which it has usually been presented.\",['Daya Krishna'],\"Oxford University Press, USA\",1991\n",

For Lesbians, as for most women today, the present is experience as a collision between the past and future. The first part of Sappho Was a Right-on Woman, \"\"What It Was Like,\"\" deals with the past: the guilt, the shame, the duplicity, that are part of living in a society that condemns Lesbians--when it cannot ignore them. Temporary sanctuaries (bars, gay ghettos, vacation spots) and \"\"bizarre\"\" behavior are part of the past for some Lesbians, and still very much part of the present for many. The second part of the book, \"\"Living the Future,\"\" reflects profound change taking place within society, the women's movement, and most important, within Lesbians themselves--change that make it possible for them to stop making unnecessary apologies and start function as whole people. Defying the present is still not easy, the authors say, but it is infinitely preferable to the self-degradation society has gone to such pains to teach the Lesbian. Sappho Was a Right-on Woman speaks clearly, honestly, openly, to those women and men, homosexual and heterosexual, oppressing and oppressed, who are still living in the past.

      "Removed line: Claude Montefiore, His Life and Thought.,\"As a revered scholar, philanthropist and spiritual authority, Claude Montefiore belongs to that important group of learned laymen who have sought to revolutionise Judaism. He was a founder of British Liberal Judaism at the turn of the century, considered to be the most original Anglo-Jewish religious thinker of his day, and still remains a highly controversial figure. Montefiore infuriated his enemies and often alientated his supporters with his radical agenda in which he applied the findings of historical and literary analysis to the Jewish scriptures, attempted to radically systemise rabbinic thought, and by his desire to learn from and re-express aspects of Christian theology. The extent to which he incorporated the teachings of Jesus and Paul into his own ethical and theological musings makes him unique among Jewish reformers. In his dealings with Christians and Christian thought, he can also be regarded as a forerunner to those who would later fully partake in Jewish-Christian dialogue. The Life and Thought of Claude Montefiore is an intellectual history and biography, together with an attempt to place Montefiore within the context of Jewish thought during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Controversially, it argues that Montefiore's own personal conception of Liberal Judiasm, which was never fully appreciated by his followers, should be regarded as more than simply a progressive Jewish denomination, and rather as an attempt to re-mould Reform Judaism in terms of contemporary liberal Christianity. Montefiore is an important figure in Anglo-Jewish history, not least for the way in which his complex identity reflects the difficulty inherent in attempting to make Judaism genuinely relevant to the modern world.\",['Daniel R.

And in Pantagruel and its three sequels, Rabelais parodied tall tales of chivalry and satirized the law, theology and academia to portray the bookish son of Gargantua who becomes a Renaissance Socrates, divinely guided in his wisdom, and his idiotic, self-loving companion Panurge.\",['Francois Rabelais'],Penguin UK,2006-10-26\n",

      "Removed line: Journey into Darkness: Genocide in Rwanda (Williams-Ford Texas A&M, University Military History Series),\"In July 1994, Thomas P. Odom was part of the U.S. Embassy team that responded to the Goma refugee crisis. He witnessed the deaths of 70,000 refugees in a single week. In the previous three months of escalating violence, the Rwandan genocide had claimed 800,000 dead. Now, in this vivid and unsettling new book, Odom offers the first insider look at these devastating events before, during, and after the genocide. Odom draws on his years of experience as a Defense Attach? and foreign area specialist in the United States Army to offer a complete picture of the situation in Zaire and Rwanda, focusing on two U.S. embassies, intelligence operations, U.N. peacekeeping efforts, and regional reactions. His team attempted to slow the death by cholera of refugees in Goma, guiding in a U.S. Joint Task Force and Operation Support Hope and remaining until the United States withdrew its forces forty days later. After U.S. forces departed, Odom crossed into Rwanda to spend the next eighteen months reestablishing the embassy, working with the Rwandan government, and creating the U.S.-Rwandan Demining office. Odom assisted the U.S. Ambassador and served as the principal military advisor on Rwanda to the U.S. Department of Defense and National Security Council throughout his time in Rwanda. His book candidly reveals Odom's frustration with Washington as his predictions that a larger war was coming were ignored. Unfortunately, he was proven correct: the current death toll in that unfortunate country is close to three million. Odom's account of the events in Rwanda illustrate not only illustrate how failures in intelligence and policy happen, but also show that a human context is necessary to comprehend these political decisions.\",['Thomas P.

      "Removed line: The Arabs,: A short history,\"The history of Arabia is inextricably tied to the history of Islam. The Prophet Muhammad came from Arabia, and the most important religious centers for Muslims are located in the Arab cities of Mecca and Medina. However, Arabs already had a history reaching back over one and a half millennia when Muhammad entered the stage. Since the ninth century B.C.E., they had been an integral force in determining the fate of the Middle East, establishing themselves as a major power in the seventh century C.E. and with the rise of the caliphate expanding the borders of the Arab world far beyond the Middle East into North Africa and Spain, and even into France. Since that time, Arab history has been intimately connected with European history. Medieval European arts and sciences would have been unthinkable without the brilliant culture of the Arab empire. Only in the modern era has this relationship been marked by a growing European hegemony, which continues to encumber relations between the West and the Arab world to the present day. In this volume, Heinz Halm offers a compact and comprehensible overview of the history and culture of the Arabs from the first references in the inscriptions of Assyrian kings to the most recent developments of contemporary Arab nations.\",['Heinz Halm'],Markus Wiener Pub,2007\n",

Defining technology transfer as 'the process of getting technical knowledge, ideas, services, inventions, and products from their origin to wherever they can be put to practical use', this book, first published in 1991, explores the role of the information specialist in the technology transfer process. It brings together discussions from information mediaries associated with federal information centres, academic research institutions, and a large metropolitan public library. Agencies and organizations at the federal, state, and local level that are involved in and responsible for technology transfer programs are described in a who's who section of the volume, and the system for the distribution of information at NASA is covered in detail, this being considered by some to be the birthplace of the technology transfer concept. The various regional NASA Industrial Application Centers are also identified, and the numerous print and online services available are noted as well. Other topics covered include the use of technology transfer in agricultural programs to improve U.S. competitiveness in the global marketplace and how the large public library can promote technology transfer by acting as important centres for information transfer and research.\",['Cynthia Steinke'],Routledge,2019-12-20\n",

Set in a dangerous near future world, The Book of M tells the captivating story of a group of ordinary people caught in an extraordinary catastrophe who risk everything to save the ones they love. It is a sweeping debut that illuminates the power that memories have not only on the heart, but on the world itself. One afternoon at an outdoor market in India, a man's shadow disappears-an occurrence science cannot explain. He is only the first. The phenomenon spreads like a plague, and while those afflicted gain a strange new power, it comes at a horrible price: the loss of all their memories. Ory and his wife Max have escaped the Forgetting so far by hiding in an abandoned hotel deep in the woods. Their new life feels almost normal, until one day Max's shadow disappears too. Knowing that the more she forgets, the more dangerous she will become to Ory, Max runs away. But Ory refuses to give up the time they have left together. Desperate to find Max before her memory disappears completely, he follows her trail across a perilous, unrecognizable world, braving the threat of roaming bandits, the call to a new war being waged on the ruins of the capital, and the rise of a sinister cult that worships the shadowless. As they journey, each searches for answers: for Ory, about love, about survival, about hope; and for Max, about a new force growing in the south that may hold the cure. Like The Passage and Station Eleven, this haunting, thought-provoking, and beautiful novel explores fundamental questions of memory, connection, and what it means to be human in a world turned upside down.\",['Peng Shepherd'],HarperCollins,2018-06-05\n",

Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software.

He claims that in societies experiencing periods of anxiety and intense spirituality, such as those of ancient Egypt and the Middle Ages, artistic production tends toward a flat, crystalline \"\"abstraction,\"\" while cultures that are oriented toward science and the physical world, like ancient Greece and Renaissance Italy, are dominated by more naturalistic, embodied styles, which he grouped under the term \"\"empathy.\"\" As was traditional for art history at the time, Worringer's book remained firmly engaged with the past, ignoring contemporaneous artistic production. Yet in the wake of its publication-just one year after Pablo Picasso painted his masterpiece \"\"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\"\"-\"\"Abstraction and Empathy\"\" came to be seen as fundamental for understanding the rise of Expressionism and the role of abstraction in the early twentieth century.\",['Wilhelm Worringer'],,2014-02-26\n",

Captured by two Ojibwa Indians as a child in 1789 from present-day Kentucky and carried north into the Michigan Territory, John Tanner was allowed to live but was badly mistreated; although a capable, adaptive boy, the more he tried to be Indian the more he was rejected for being white.

Waddell,\"The last shot of the Civil War was fired, not on an obscure battlefield, but in the ice-locked Sea of Okhotsk off Siberia seven months after Lee's surrender. The last armed Confederate cruiser was the C.S.S. Shenandoah, a beautiful but dangerous vessel which scattered and burned the New Bedford whaling fleet in Arctic waters. She was the last cruiser sent to sea by James Dunwoody Bulloch, the captain who built the Confederacy's navy in the shipyards of Europe. Constructed at a cost of ?53,715, the Shenandoah captured thirty-eight ships and burned thirty-two. She inflicted damage to Union commerce which was officially judged at $1,361,983. She took 1,053 prisoners. In fact, she took so many her skipper, Lieutenant-Commanding James Waddell, had to rig a chain of whaleboats that could be towed along by his vessel, to accommodate captured Union seamen and the crews of the whalers he had burned. A few years after the war, Waddell wrote his account of the Shenandoah's great cruise, and it is published here complete for the first time. He tells of his own career in the United States Navy and in the Confederate Navy, and also of the events leading up to his taking command of the Shenandoah.\",['James D. Horan'],Crown,2012-11-07\n",

Fourteen of the ship's 43 crewmen died in the crash. The Shenandoah was America's first rigid dirigible. It was longer than two football fields and powered by five 300-horsepower Packard engines. Ripped apart by strong winds over rural Ohio, the buoyant nose of the ship circled helplessly in the storm for nearly an hour, finally coming to rest 12 miles away where six crewmen staggered out dazed but alive. Thousands of curiosity-seekers swarmed the crash sites, trampling crops, flattening fences and stripping the carcass of the great ship almost bare. Army troops were called in to maintain control. The crash made front-page news around the world. But as the years have passed, this historic event has all but faded from our collective memory.

Top 100 Exotic Food Plants provides comprehensive coverage of tropical and semitropical food plants, reviewing scientific and technological information as well as their culinary uses.

The myriad facets of the composer's personality sparkle and flash as the author reminisces about his brilliant and magnetic friend. Puccini: simple and earthy, a man who liked driving fast, bird shooting and flirting with pretty girls; a man who drew strength from his beloved Tuscan soil, and fell head-over-heels in love with the heroines created by his imagination. The author recalls Puccini's wild adolescence, his love affairs, his stormy life with Donna Elvira, and the tragedy of the innocent Doria. Here is Puccini celebrating the success of La Bohemne by buying an expensive bicycle, Tosca by the largest and noisiest automobile he could find, and his American triumph with an imported speedboat. You see Puccini in love with a story, flinging himself passionately into creative activity; other times having to be prodded by his patient publisher. You see him enjoying the hunt, basking in the convivial companionship of bohemian friends, and incessantly quarreling with poets and librettists. You learn of his violent quarrels with the musician he respected most, Toscinini, to whom he entrusted his final and incomplete opera, Turnadot.\",['Dante Del Fiorentino'],,1952\n",

      "Removed line: The Road to Pearl Harbor, The Coming of the War Between the United States and Japan.,\"This is a probing narrative of the history which came to its climax at Pearl harbor; an account of the attitudes and actions, of the purposes and persons which brought about the war between the United States and Japan. It is full and impartial. Though written as an independent and private study, records and information of an exceptional range and kind were used in its making. These give it authority. They include all the pertinent State Department papers; the American official military records in preparation; selections from the Roosevelt papers at Hyde Park; the full private diaries of Stimons, Morgenthau, and Grew; the file of the intercepted \"\"Magic\"\" cables; and equivalent collections of official and private Japanese records. The author was at the time in the State Department (as Adviser on International Economic Affairs) and thus in close touch with the men and matters of which he writes. In telling how this war came about, this book tells much of how other wars happen. For it is a close study of the ways in which officials, diplomats, and soldiers think and act; of the environment of decision, of the ambitions of nations, of the clash of their ideas, of the way sin which fear and mistrust affect events, and of the struggle for time and advantage. The narrative follows events in a double mirror of which one side is Washington and the other Tokyo, and synchronizes the images. Thus it traces the ways in which the acts and decisions of this country influenced Japan and vice versa. Originally published in 1950.

Lee as he desperately led the Confederate army through the final year of the Civil War (LibraryJournal). By May 1864, Gen. Robert E. Lee had been transformed from a reluctant man who chose to fight for his state over his country into a gray-haired patriarch of the Rebel cause. General Lee was revered by his men, who followed the \"\"Old Man\"\" as if he could hold off defeat by sheer force of will. But as fighting began in earnest once again, Lee could sense a change. The Union army's new commander, Ulysses S. Grant, was not like his predecessors. He was a fighter, he was in Virginia, and he's wasn't going to run. And behind Grant and his massive army were the bedrock pillars of Northern industry and infrastructure. Meanwhile, Lee's increasingly ragged and starving army had little keeping them going except raw courage, determination-and belief in their leader. Lee had to take action or give up all hope of victory. Lee's Last Campaign is a triumph of historical research and elegant writing. In this essential analysis of General Lee's military strategy at a major turning point in history, Clifford Dowdey follows the triumphs and tragedies of the Army of Northern Virginia as it entered the final year of the Civil War.

Chronicled in these illuminating pages is life on the sugar plantations; the painful experience of caste hierarchy and racism; the devastation of World War; peace, colonialism, and the struggle for independence from imperialism. Subtly and concisely, Jagan outlines the corporate and economic interests involved in attempting to perpetuate colonial subjugation in British Guiana. Larger in scope than Jagan's Forbidden Freedom (also available from International Publishers), The West on Trial provides important historical context that enables readers to grasp the pivotal post-World War II period of anti-colonial, national liberation movements and the role of British and U.S. imperialism throughout the 1950s and 1960s in destabilizing democratically elected popular governments.

However, much less attention has been paid to the strategies of persuasion employed by the regimes to win over the masses for their cause. Among these, fascist propaganda has traditionally been seen as the key means of influencing public opinion. Only recently has the fascination with Fascism become a topic of enquiry that has also formed the guiding interest of this volume: it offers, for the first time, a comparative analysis of the forms and functions of theater in countries governed by fascist or para-fascist regimes. By examining a wide spectrum of theatrical manifestations in a number of States with a varying degree of fascistization, these studies establish some of the similarities and differences between the theatrical cultures of several cultures in the interwar period.\",\"['Gunter Berghaus', 'G?nter Berghaus']\",Berghahn Books,1996\n",

Agincourt is the quintessential English battle. Outnumbered English forces meet the French on the battlefield, and through courage, tenacity, (and a wicked Welsh weapon called a longbow), they win the day. While Henry V was triumphant, and was immortalized by Shakespeare for his victory, his gains were later squandered by his son, Henry VI, so ultimately not much was accomplished. In this Henty book, Guy Aylmer is an English squire and the son of a knight. He travels to Villeroy, in France, where his lord has a castle, but is swept up in it's defense when it is attacked by Orleanist forces. He winds-up as a prisoner in Paris where he and his charges are assaulted by the White Hoods-the butchers of Paris. After several adventures and escapes he later returns to France with King Henry V and fights in the Battle of Agincourt.

Through his relationship with two other boys T?rless is led into sadistic and sexual encounters with a third pupil which both repel and fascinate him. Estranged from everyday life, T?rless gradually learns to accept his experiences and describe them with analytical precision. The novel is based on the author's own experiences at an Austrian military academy. A school story with a difference, T?rless extends the scope of fiction with its non-judgemental presentation of transgressive sexuality and violence. It is a profoundly disturbing exploration of a non-moral outlook on life and of dictatorial attitudes that prefigure the outbreak of the First World War and the rise of fascism.

      "Removed line: True to the old flag,: A tale of the American war of independence,\"You have probably been accustomed to regard the war between England and her colonies in America as one in which we were not only beaten but, to some extent, humiliated. Owing to the war having been an unsuccessful one for our arms, British writers have avoided the subject, and it has been left for American historians to describe. These, writing for their own countrymen, and drawing for their facts upon gazettes, letters, and other documents emanating from one side only, have, naturally, and no doubt insensibly, given a very strong color to their own views of the events, and English writers have been too much inclined to accept their account implicitly. There is, however, another and very different side to the story, and this I have endeavored to show you. The whole of the facts and details connected with the war can be relied upon as accurate. They are drawn from the valuable account of the struggle written by Major Steadman, who served under Howe, Clinton, and Cornwallis, and from other authentic contemporary sources. You will see that, although unsuccessful,--and success was, under the circumstances, a sheer impossibility,--the British troops fought with a bravery which was never exceeded, and that their victories in actual conflict vastly outnumbered their defeats. Indeed, it may be doubted whether in any war in which this country has been engaged have our soldiers exhibited the qualities of endurance and courage to a higher degree.\",['G. A.

      "Removed line: A Personal War in Vietnam (Williams-Ford Texas A&M, University Military History Series),\"In April 1969, Linda Moore-Lanning watched her husband, Lt. Michael Lee Lanning, board a Greyhound bus that would take him to a military flight scheduled to deposit him in Vietnam. As he boarded the bus, Lee told her, \"\"It's only for a year.\"\" Moore-Lanning struggled to believe her husband's words. Waiting: One Wife's Year of the Vietnam War is the deeply personal account of Moore-Lanning's year as a waiting wife. The first-ever book from the perspective of a wife on the home front during the Vietnam War, Moore-Lanning's telling is both unflinching in its honesty and universal in its evocation of the price exacted from those who were left behind. During her \"\"waiting year,\"\" Moore-Lanning traveled far, in both distance and perspective, from the small West Texas town of Roby where she had grown up and met her husband. Through her eyes, we experience the agony of waiting for the next letter from Lee; the exhilaration of learning of her pregnancy; the frustration of dealing with friends and family members who didn't understand her struggles; and the solace of companionship with Susan Hargrove, another waiting wife. Because of her insistence that Lee give her an honest account of his experiences, Moore-Lanning also affords readers a gut-wrenching view of Vietnam as narrated by an infantry commander in the field. Unfolding with the gripping narrative of a novel, Waiting will captivate general readers, while those interested in military history and home front perspectives-especially from the Vietnam War-will deeply appreciate this impressive addition to the literature.\",['Linda Moore-Lanning'],Texas A&M University Press,2009-09-28\n",

There are \"\"outlaws\"\" of Halfaday Creek live, a band of doughty prospectors ruled by their self-appointed czar, Black John Smith, one of many John Smiths that inhabit that notorious lair.Law and order, however, are nowhere so well maintained as on Halfaday Creek, and Black John dispenses justice with the wisdom of a Solomon and a heart as big as the biggest nugget ever found in the gold rush days. Murder is one of the minor hangable offenses there; skullduggery, connivin' and conspirin' are punished by the rope, after a miners' meeting passes an irrevocable sentence. Confidence men, city slickers, anyone who would take advantage of another man, woman or child, are dealt with sharply, and with a geniality that disarms evildoers unfamiliar with Black John's swift, efficient legal procedure.In this warmhearted and humorous chronicle of strange doings on Halfday, Corporal Downey of the Mounted and Black John and Old Cush punish some murderers, claim robbers and scoundrels who have made the mistake of assuming that the \"\"outlaws\"\" are not men of honor. Black John needs no introduction to his many admirers; he is one of out most honest and lovable rogues.\",['James B. Hendryx'],\"Steeger Properties, LLC\",2019-12-16\n",

      "Removed line: Frontier woman,: The life of a woman homesteader on the Dakota frontier,\"\"\"The last American frontier lay in the dry region of the Dakotas and Montana, a land that had been invaded from the south in the 1880's and 1890's by the open range cattle and sheep interests. Into this dry region came the homesteaders from the Midwest and from Europe seeking free land. Known by the cattlemen as the \"\"wool hat people\"\" they swarmed west of the Missouri River after 1890, built their sod houses, plowed up the prairies, and planted their crops. Many of them failed because of drought and grasshoppers, or went back because of the struggle, the loneliness, the hard life. One of the thousands who moved to this dry frontier west of the Missouri was Grace Fairchild. She had grown up in Wisconsin, graduated from Platteville Normal with a teacher's certificate, and had gone to Parker, South Dakota (east of the Missouri) to teach school in 1898. There at Parker she married Shiloh Fairchild, a widower much older than she, and in 1902 the Fairchilds went west of the Missouri seeking a homestead. They took up a claim of 160 acres in the old Sioux Indian cession, not far from the present Philip. Married to a man not fitted to be a pioneer farmer, she took on increased responsibilities as the years went by, and finally separated from her husband. When she left the ranch, she owned 1440 acres of South Dakota land. This is the story of a strong woman who succeeded on a harsh frontier where failure was common. South Dakota State University recognized her in 1952 with the title of Eminent Homemaker and now her picture hangs in the Hall of Fame. Few books tell the story of a woman pioneer who was a mother, a manager, a creative force in the building of her part of the last frontier. This is Folk History told through the original notes of a Frontier Woman.\"\"--BOOK COVER.\",['Walker Demarquis Wyman'],University of Wisconsin Riverfalls Press,1972\n",

      "Removed line: A Concordance to the Greek Testament, Fourth Edition,\"This book is a completely revised and reset edition of the best-selling A Concordance to the Greek Testament edited by W. F. Moulton and A. S. Geden. Originally published in 1897, it has remained in print ever since. It is beyond any doubt the most useful basic tool available for the student of the New Testament. The original edition was primarily based on the Greek text of Westcott and Hort, but gave all the variants in the edition of Tischendorf and in the Greek text underlying the Revised Version of the English Bible; quotations are given with grammatical completeness as far as possible; a significant feature is the inclusion of the Hebrew text of direct quotations from the Old Testament; asterisks and daggers indicate whether the vocabulary items in the New Testament are found in Classical Greek and in the Septuagint.This new edition retains all the features of the earlier editions, but it is primarily based on the Greek text in The Greek New Testament (4th edition), which is identical with that in Novum Testamentum Graece (27th edition), currently the two most widely used editions of the Greek New Testament; it incorporates the main marginal readings in the former of these texts; references to the variants in the older editions are preserved, so that the student has to hand every reading which by even a remote probability might be regarded as forming part of the true text of the New Testament. The Supplement incorporating the prepositions has been included in the main text of the Concordance. Where the same word occurs twice in the same verse, these occurrences are now printed on separate lines and individually verse-numbered so that it is easier to count the number of occurrences of any given word. Special new Greek fonts have been created to enable great clarity in the printing.\",\"['William Fiddian Moulton', 'Alfred Shenington Geden', 'Harold Keeling Moulton']\",A&C Black,2004-07-27\n",

Congress authorized the organization of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (later renamed Women's Army Corps) in 1942, and hundreds of women were able to join in the war effort. Charity Edna Adams became the first black woman commissioned as an officer. Black members of the WAC had to fight the prejudices not only of males who did not want women in their \"\"man's army,\"\" but also of those who could not accept blacks in positions of authority or responsibility, even in the segregated military. With unblinking candor, Charity Adams Earley tells of her struggles and successes as the WAC's first black officer and as commanding officer of the only organization of black women to serve overseas during World War II. The 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion broke all records for redirecting military mail as she commanded the group through its moves from England to France and stood up to the racist slurs of the general under whose command the battalion operated. The Six Triple Eight stood up for its commanding officer, supporting her boycott of segregated living quarters and recreational facilities. This book is a tribute to those courageous women who paved the way for patriots, regardless of color or gender, to serve their country.\",['Charity Adams Earley'],Texas A&M University Press,1989\n",

Rockefeller, Sr.-the Jekyll-and-Hyde of American capitalism. In the course of his nearly 98 years, Rockefeller was known as both a rapacious robber baron, whose Standard Oil Company rode roughshod over an industry, and a philanthropist who donated money lavishly to universities and medical centers. He was the terror of his competitors, the bogeyman of reformers, the delight of caricaturists-and an utter enigma. Drawing on unprecedented access to Rockefeller's private papers, Chernow reconstructs his subjects' troubled origins (his father was a swindler and a bigamist) and his single-minded pursuit of wealth. But he also uncovers the profound religiosity that drove him \"\"to give all I could\"\"; his devotion to his father; and the wry sense of humor that made him the country's most colorful codger. Titan is a magnificent biography-balanced, revelatory, elegantly written.\",['Ron Chernow'],Vintage,2007-12-18\n",

If you're struggling to stay on top of your to-do list, you probably have a good reason: anxiety, fatigue, depression, ADHD, or lack of support. For therapist KC Davis, the birth of her second child triggered a stress-mess cycle. The more behind she felt, the less motivated she was to start. She didn't fold a single piece of laundry for seven months. One life-changing realization restored her sanity-and the functionality of her home: You don't work for your home; your home works for you. In other words, messiness is not a moral failing. A new sense of calm washed over her as she let go of the shame-based messaging that interpreted a pile of dirty laundry as \"\"I can never keep up\"\" and a chaotic kitchen as \"\"I'm a bad mother.\"\" Instead, she looked at unwashed clothes and thought, \"\"I am alive,\"\" and at stacks of dishes and thought, \"\"I cooked my family dinner three nights in a row.\"\" Building on this foundation of self-compassion, KC devised the powerful practical approach that has exploded in popularity through her TikTok account, @domesticblisters. The secret is to simplify your to-do list and to find creative workarounds that accommodate your limited time and energy. In this book, you'll learn exactly how to customize your cleaning strategy and rebuild your relationship with your home, including: -How to see chores as kindnesses to your future self, not as a reflection of your worth -How to start by setting priorities -How to stagger tasks so you won't procrastinate -How to clean in quick bursts within your existing daily routine -How to use creative shortcuts to transform a room from messy to functional With KC's help, your home will feel like a sanctuary again. It will become a place to rest, even when things aren't finished. You will move with ease, and peace and calm will edge out guilt, self-criticism, and endless checklists. They have no place here.\",['KC Davis'],Simon and Schuster,2022-04-26\n",

      "Removed line: A.P. Hill, Lee's forgotten general,\"A. P. Hill: Lee's Forgotten General is the first biography of the Confederacy's long-neglected hero whom Lee ranked next to Jackson and Longstreet. Although the name and deeds ot this gallant Virginian conspicuously punctuate the record of every major campaign of the Army of Northern Virginia, the man himself has persistently remained what Douglas Southall Freman termed an \"\"elusive personality.\"\" William Woods Hassler, through careful and persistent research, has compiled an interesting documentary study from which emerges a balanced portrait of this distinguished but complex character. Here for the first time is detailed the romantic triangle which enmeshed Hill and McClellan, former roommates at West Point, with beauteous Nelly Marcy, reigning queen of pre-war Washington's younger set. Hill lost this contest to Nelly's parents, but he later won the hand of General John Hunt Morgan's lovely and talented sister, Dolly. And at Sharpsburg, Hill wreaked vengeance upon McClellan by his timely arrival which saved Lee from defeat at the same time it spelled McClellan's subsequent dismissal from command of the Army of the Potomac. The author traces Hill's meteoric rise from Colonel of the redoubtable Thirteenth Virginia Regiment to Major General in command of the famed Light Division. Against a \"\"you are there\"\" background of intimate detail, the reader follows the exploits of tempestous Ambrose Powell Hill as he welds his officers and men into fierce striking units. Where the fighing is thickests there is the red-haired, red-shirted Hill brandishing his sword and exhorting his men to victory. Sometimes the issue ends ignominiously as at Bristoe Station, but more often the outcome is glorious as at Second Manassas and Reams Station. Gray greats and near-greats stalk through these pages with vivid reality as one meets Jeb Stuart, Dorsey Pender, John Hood, Heros von Borcke, Ham Chamerlayne, Willie Pegram, Rev. J. Wm. Jones, Cadmus Wilcox, Harry Heth, J. R. Anderson, Lawrence O'Brien Branch, James Archer, Jim Lane, Thomas Wooten, Charles Field, George Tucker, Kyd Douglas, Johnston Pettigrew, Moxley Sorrel, William H. Palmer, Wade Hampton, Jube Early, Lindsay Walker, Maxcy Gregg, Sam McGowan, and others. Accompanying Hill and his commands from pre-Manassas to the final breakthrough at Petersburg, the reader relives the campaigns in the Eastern theater. At the same time the reader gains a deeper insight into the problems of command, together with an appreciation of the hardships which the Confederate soldiers endured during even the early days of the conflict. Although Powell Hill's consideration and ability won for him the unbounded respect and devotion of his troops, his proud, sensitive nature continually embroiled him with his superiors. His dispute with Longstreet following the Seven Days Battles almost culminated in a duel. Transferred to Jackson's command, Hill outspokenly quarreled with \"\"Old Jack\"\" until the latter's mortal wounding at Chancellorsville effected a dramatic battlefield reconciliation. As Jackson's successor, Hill performed irregularly. The author analyzes objectively the various factors which may have caused the changes in Hill's fortunes following his elevation to corps command.\",['William W.

      "Removed line: The brothers Karamazov,,\"In 1880 Dostoevsky completed The Brothers Karamazov, the literary effort for which he had been preparing all his life. Compelling, profound, complex, it is the story of a patricide and of the four sons who each had a motive for murder: Dmitry, the sensualist, Ivan, the intellectual; Alyosha, the mystic; and twisted, cunning Smerdyakov, the bastard child. Frequently lurid, nightmarish, always brilliant, the novel plunges the reader into a sordid love triangle, a pathological obsession, and a gripping courtroom drama. But throughout the whole, Dostoevsky searhes for the truth--about man, about life, about the existence of God. A terrifying answer to man's eternal questions, this monumental work remains the crowning achievement of perhaps the finest novelist of all time.

      "Removed line: A pastoral democracy,: A study of pastoralism and politics among the northern Somali of the Horn of Africa,\"First published in 1961, shortly after establishment of the independent Somali Republic, the first step towards the formation of a 'Greater Somalia', brought this North-East African Muslim nation a prominence which it had not enjoyed since the British campaigns against the 'Mad Mullah' in the first two decades of the twentieth century. Somali nationalism, however, cannot be properly understood without a knowledge of the indigenous social organization. This study by a social anthropologist describes the political system of the Northern Somali nomads in their arid ecological setting, where competition for access to water and pasture, especially in the dry season, is acute and leads to frequent and often long-drawn-out feuds. In this warlike society political status depends very largely on numerical strength. Political loyalties based on kinship are organized through a form of Social Contract which distinguishes the pastoral Somali political system from otherwise similar political structures. Today this traditional organization is being challenged in areas where cultivation has recently been adopted, and in towns which are the foci of modern developments. Somali nationalism, drawing much of its strength from the unifying force of Islam, is an important factor. With the continued dedication of the majority of the population to pastoral nomadism, however, traditional clan and contractual loyalties inevitably play an important part in party politics. This analysis has proved to be of interest not only to anthropologists and Africanists, but also to students of Islamic society and of comparative political institutions.\",['I. M.

In this episode, Brenner-forced out of the police force-tries to get away from detective work by taking a job as the personal chauffeur for two-year-old Helena, the daughter of a Munich construction giant and a Viennese abortion doctor. One day, while Brenner's attention is turned to picking out a chocolate bar for Helena at a gas station, Helena gets snatched from the car. Abruptly out of a job, Brenner decides to investigate her disappearance on his own. With both parents in the public eye, there's no scarcity of leads-the father's latest development project has spurred public protest, and the mother's clinic has been targeted by the zealous leader of an anti-abortion group. Brenner and God is told with a dark humor that leaves no character, including Brenner, unscathed. Haas tells the story of a fallible hero who can be indecisive and world-weary, baffled and disillusioned by what he finds, but who presses forward nonetheless out of a stubborn sense of decency-a two-year-old is kidnapped, so you find her, because that's just what you do.\",\"['Margaret Weis', 'Tracy Hickman']\",Spectra,1990\n",

      "Removed line: Safety Last: The Dangers of Commerical Aviation, an Indictment by an Airline Pilot,\"*THIS IS THE REPUBLISHED VERSION. THE ORIGINAL VERSION WAS PUBLISHED IN 1972. THIS VERSION DOES NOT CONTAIN ADDITIONAL OR NEW INFORMATION. The author of this eye-opening expose is a scheduled jet airline captain, as well as a fighter pilot in the Air Force Reserve, with twenty years of professional flying experience. Writing from the standpoint of a view of a pilot, he covers every aspect of commercial aviation and brings the reader to the conclusion that it is a much more perilous means of transportation than generally suspected. You will learn how poorly equipped most of our airports are; how the airlines write their own safety regulations and then succeed in evading even those requirements. You will find out what goes on on the flight deck and the dangers inherent in even the most routine shuttle flights. The author examines crash investigations, he take you on spine-tingling reconstructions of disasters you probably read about, and he reveals the often shocking truth of what really went wrong as opposed to what you may have read in the papers. ********** \"\"Safety Last by Captain Brian Power-Waters courageously describes real life in the airline industry and sounds the alarm for urgently needed reforms. It documents the abysmal performance of the Federal Aviation Administration in enforcing air safety standards and the shocking insensitivity of many airline officials. This book should be read by any airline passenger, executive, regulator or legislator who is concerned about protecting human life and safety in air travel.\"\" Reuben Robertson III, Director of the Aviation Consumer Action Project and Aide to Ralph Nader ********** \"\"Captain Power-Waters unloads his list of complaints against commercial aviation without hedging and draws a frightening picture of chaos, carelessness and petty internecine warfare within the industry. The literate air traveler who gets his hands on this book may want to swear off forever. . . . Captain Power-Waters hits with authority.\"\" Publishers Weekly ********** \"\"Fortunately, most of the flying public is unaware that many in airline management place a greater emphasis on making profits than on adhering to safety regulations. I compliment you on providing us with a damn fine insight into many of the problems which have been either overlooked or purposely evaded. I strongly concur in your book's closing observation that the real key to airline safety must be through a better utilization of the expertise of the pilot and the controller, who know flying best. These men are indebted to you for your daring to buck the tide, and call it as you see it.\"\" From a letter to Captain Power-Waters from John F. Leyden, President, Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization ********** \"\"Safety Last is a fascinating and sobering journey into the realities of commercial aviation. It vividly describes the hazards of non-professionalism in our industry. The reader will also see the critical importance of professional aircraft maintenance along with the need for a more imaginative and aggressive FAA establishment. . . . Captain Power-Waters has courageously assailed the FAA-approved Minimum Equipment List and exposed it for what it is . . . a killer of airline passengers.\"\" James Douglas Sparling, Director, Safety and Standards, Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association Safety Last was originally published in 1972, there are no new updates in this version.\",['Brian Power-Waters'],iUniverse,2001\n",

Since its publication in 1980, the immigrant groups it discusses in depth have matured and new ones have been added to the mix. The present work tracks the course of these changes over the past twenty years, constructing a historical understanding of each group as it evolved from race to ethnicity to culture. Individual chapters begin with an overview of one of fifteen groups. Following the development of its unique ethnocultural identity, distinctive character traits such as temperament and emotional expression are explored-as well as ethnic stereotypes. Also discussed are modifications to the group's ethnocultural identity over time and generational change-which traits may have changed over generations and which are more hardwired or enduring. An important feature of each chapter is the focus on the group's family social structure, generational and gender roles, power distribution, and central values and life goals. Readers will also find a description of the group's own internal social class structure, social and political strategies, and occupational and educational patterns. Finally, contributors consider how a particular ethnic group has blended into Hawai'i's culturally sensitive society. People and Cultures of Hawai'i: The Evolution of Culture and Ethnicity will, like its predecessor, fill an important niche in understanding the history of different ethnic groups in Hawai'i.\",['Thomas W.

      "Removed line: Trial and error,: The autobiography of Chaim Weizmann,\"Chaim Weizmann's autobiography is a highly personal account of his life in the Zionist movement. Book One, completed in 1941, covers the years 1874-1917 and Book Two covers the years 1918-1948. Weizmann describes the Russian shtetl where he was born in 1874, his schooling in Pinsk and his university studies in Berlin, Geneva and Freiburg (Switzerland) where he received his PhD in chemistry in 1899 before moving to Manchester in 1904. He portrays many leading Zionists such as Theodor Herzl, Achad Ha-am, Max Nordau, Shmarya Levin, Ussishkin, Jabotinsky, Ruppin. He describes the opposition by assimilationist Jews (like Edwin Montagu) to Zionism, and internal debates within the Zionist movement, such as the defeat of Herzl's Uganda plan - bitterly opposed by Weizmann - at the 6th Zionist Congress (1903) and his frictions with the American Zionists led by Brandeis. Weizmann describes how, during World War I, his work on acetone brought him into contact with British political leaders such as Lloyd George, Arthur Balfour and Winston Churchill and facilitated the Balfour Declaration which, in 1917, paved the way for \"\"the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people\"\". Weizmann recounts his role in the creation of what would become Israel's leading scientific institutions, the Hebrew University, the Weizmann Institute of Science and the Technion, including his fundraising efforts in Europe and in the United States on their behalf and for other Zionist initiatives. He became the first President of Israel, and died in office in 1952. \"\"... one of the important historical documents of our time.\"\" - Orville Prescott, The New York Times (January 19, 1949) \"\"[Trial and Error] is likely to be read for many years to come as an authoritative exposition of the Zionist movement ... records eye-witness accounts of so many crucial events and reflects so many deep insights that it is certain to become of permanent value to the scholar and a delight to the general reader.\"\" - Salo Baron, The New York Times (January 23, 1949) \"\"There are four angles from which one can approach this book. One can take it as a history of Zionism during the last seventy years... a record of personal endeavour triumphant over obstacles and dissension... a sad commentary upon human achievement, when eventual triumph comes at a date, and in circumstances, which rob it of its full savour... the self-portrait of a most remarkable man.\"\" - Harold Nicolson, The Observer (March 27, 1949) \"\"Notable in this intellectually candid record is the fact that [Weizmann] embraced and propagated Jewish nationalism because he regarded it as a positive good, not merely a negative escape from gentile persecution. This intensely human book, which in a sense is the story of modern Zionism, constitutes one of the indispensable sources for the history of our times.\"\" - Robert Gale Woolbert, Foreign Affairs (July 1949) \"\"[Weizmann's] autobiography ... is an astonishingly objective and life-like narrative, without a trace of dramatization, exaggeration, vanity, self-pity, self-justification; it conveys his authentic, richly and evenly developed, autonomous, proud, firmly built, somewhat ironical nature, free from inner conflict, in deep, instinctive harmony with the forces of nature and society, and therefore possessed of natural wisdom, dignity and authority.\"\" - Sir Isaiah Berlin, Chichele Professor of Social and Political Theory, Oxford University (November 19, 1957) \"\"Ranks between Churchill's war memoirs and those of Nehru, Masaryk and Trotzky, among the founders' own stories ... above all a human book, the record of the experiences and reactions of a man who fought over issues that were important\"\" - Congress Bulletin (April 1949)\",['Chaim Weizmann'],Plunkett Lake Press,2019-07-31\n",

      "Removed line: The same door,: Short stories,\"The title of John Updike's first short story collection, published when the author was twenty-seven, alludes to the old superstition that you should enter and leave a house by the same door. Thus John Nordholm, the alternately shy and brash hero of the first story here, is also the narrator of the last. Yet there is a sense in which all sixteen of these stories knock at the same door, a door that in \"\"Dentistry and Doubt\"\" swings open, and in \"\"Toward Evening\"\" remains shut. The characters are polite, nervous, diffident, as if life-or at least youth, for they are all young-were a discomfiting wait in the anteroom of the absolute. The majority of these stories depict encounters between strangers and their unexpected effects, which can be as concrete as a roomful of flowers or a bottle of wine, or as intangible as a miracle or a dream.\",['John Updike'],Random House,2012-09-18\n",

      "Removed line: Paul, The Theology of the Apostole in the Light of Jewish History,\"A major study of the apostle to the Gentiles, combining exceptional scholarship with an unusual approach. Schoeps interprets Paul's theology in the light of his Jewish background, which coloured and conditioned his Christological teaching. Paul's conception of Jesus differs from that of the Synoptics: what and how extensive the difference is and whence it is derived are among the questions Schoeps examines. After surveying major problems in Pauline research, the Author relates the apostle to primitive Christianity, discussing his eschatology and his teachings on salvation, the law, and saving history. The final chapter shows that Paul's distinctive doctrines result from two converging factors, that Paul never saw Jesus in the flesh, and the influence of Jewish teaching. The consequence was his concern with the resurrected Saviour of the world, the pre-existent and eternal Son of God. Schoeps shows that Paul betrayed a fundamental misconception of the law and the covenantal agreement between God and his chosen people. The result is a thought-provoking, and somewhat startling, study of the first, the greatest, and the most difficult of all Christian theologians.\",['HJ Schoeps'],ISD LLC,2002-09-16\n",
      "Removed line: Anything Can Happen,,\"When you're in love with the wrong person for the right reasons, anything could happen. Tretch lives in a very small town where everybody's in everybody else's business. Which makes it hard for him to be in love with his straight best friend. For his part, Matt is completely oblivious to the way Tretch feels - and Tretch can't tell whether that makes it better or worse. The problem with living a lie is that the lie can slowly become your life. For Tretch, the problem isn't just with Matt. His family has no idea who he really is and what he's really thinking. The girl at the local bookstore has no clue how off-base her crush on him is. And the guy at school who's a thorn in Tretch's side doesn't realize how close to the truth he's hitting. Tretch has spent a lot of time dancing alone in his room, but now he's got to step outside his comfort zone and into the wider world. Because like love, a true self can rarely be contained. Anything Could Happen is a poignant, hard-hitting exploration of love and friendship, a provocative debut that shows that sometimes we have to let things fall apart before we can make them whole again.\",['Will Walton'],Scholastic Inc.,2015-05-26\n",

It is as Michael always demands: a Wolf Story, which begins one night at bedtime and spins wildly on through subsequent bedtimes and Sunday outings to the beach and park in a succession of ever more trickily tantalizing episodes. Waldo the wolf is sneaking up on Rainbow the hen, when Jimmy Tractorwheel, the son of the local farmer, comes along. After that, there's no knowing what will happen next, as while stalled in traffic jams or nodding off at night, the boys chime in and the story races on and Waldo finds, if not necessarily dinner, his just desserts.

Lardner, who had an excellent ear for dialogue, actually wrote these stories in the voice of the fictional rookie ballplayer Jack Keefe, a White Sox pitcher, who writes letters to his friend Al Blanchard back home in Bedford, Indiana.

      "Removed line: Far-Fetched Facts, the Literature of Travel and the Idea of the South Seas,\"4e de couverture: Far-Fetched Facts is an essay in the history of the literature of travel, real and imaginary, from classical times, via the early accounts of the New World, to the accounts of the South Sea islands that lay beyond. It follows continuities from the Odyssey to the twentieth century and traces the interplay of fact and fiction in a literature with a notorious tendency to deviate from the truth. The late medieval travels of the imaginary Mandeville and the real Marco Polo are explored, and the writings of Columbus as he struggled to reconcile what 'Mandeville' and Polo had written with what he found in the West Indies. The philosophical consequences of the discovery of the New World are followed in the works of Montaigne and Bacon, and the factual travels of Dampier are placed in relation to the fictional travels of Crusoe and Gulliver. The various accounts of the scientific voyages of Cook and Bougainville are examined and their revelation of a Tahiti more mythic than scientific, erotic as well as exotic. All the factual accounts of the mutiny on the Bounty are assessed, and also the fictions that came in its wake. The supposedly factual narrative that is Herman Melville's first novel is read in relation to other travellers' accounts of the South Seas, as are the factual and fictional writings of Loti, Stevenson, Malinowski, Mead, and the Hawaiian Visitors Bureau. Far-Fetched Facts is the first full account of the Western idea of the South Seas as it evolved from the lost paradises of biblical and classical literature to end in the false paradise found by the tourist.\",\"['Neil Rennie', 'Rennie Neil']\",Oxford University Press,1995\n",

      "Removed line: The autobiography of Alice B. Toklas (Zephyr books, a library of British and American authors),\"In this original and intriguing study, Anna Linzie examines three mid-twentieth-century texts never before treated as interrelated in a book-length work of literary criticism: Gertrude Stein's The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas (1933) and Alice B. Toklas's The Alice B. Toklas Cook Book (1954) and What Is Remembered (1963). Taking these three texts as intertexts or as an assemblage of the true story of Alice B. Toklas, Linzie challenges assumptions about primary authorship and singular identity that have continued to limit lesbian and feminist rereadings of autobiography as a genre and of Stein and Toklas as writers and historical figures.The True Story of Alice B. Toklas explores how the concept of autobiography as a primarily referential genre is challenged and transformed in relation to autobiographical texts written about the same person, the same life, but differently, by different writers, at different points in time. The concept of one true story is deconstructed in the process as Linzie modifies Homi K. Bhabha's \"\"almost the same but not quite/not white\"\" for the purposes of this particular study as \"\"almost the same but not quite/not straight.\"\" The investigation moves simultaneously on the planes of textuality and sexuality in order to provisionally articulate a \"\"lesbian autobiographical subject\"\" in Linzie's reading of these three texts.Linzie's study fills a gap in literary criticism where Stein's companion and her work have been more or less neglected, conceptualizing the Stein-Toklas sexual/textual relationship as fundamentally reciprocal. The True Story of Alice B. Toklas provides a new critical perspective on Toklas as indispensable to Stein's literary production, a cultural laborer in her own right, and a writer of her own books. Making a significant contribution to recent lesbian/feminist reconceptualizations of the genre of autobiography, this study will fascinate Stein and Toklas scholars as well as those interested in queer and autobiography studies.\",['Anna Linzie'],University of Iowa Press,2006-04-01\n",

      "Removed line: Of love and lust ,: On the psychoanalysis of romantic and sexual emotions,\"These selections from Theodor Reik's work concern the love life and sexual activity of men and women. Reik establishes the theme of this work in the following way: \"\"The sex urge hunts for lustful pleasure; love is in search of joy and happiness.\"\" Over a third of this volume had never been published in book form before it originally appeared half a century ago. Its appearance in paperback, for the first time, is a welcome addition to current debates, liberated from ideological and political constraints. The first part of the book is so far ahead of its time that it is still current. It reveals Reik's departure from Freud's theories and from those of most of his contemporaries in psychology and psychoanalysis. Part Two is a greatly abbreviated version of Masochism in Modern Man, retaining those parts with a direct bearing on the subject of this volume. Part Three offers two essays on why people remain single. In the author's usual direct style, they deal with the marriage shyness of the male and the psychological fears and resistance of both men and women to acceptance of the marriage bond. Part Four is Reik at his wisest. \"\"The first lady whom I asked to read the manuscript said smilingly: 'Many of your impressions about us (women) are correct. No man should read the book!' A few seconds later, she said: 'Or rather, every man should read the book!'\"\" As Paul Roazen noted, \"\"in contrast to some of Freud's other followers, Reik was prescient early on in distinguishing self-love from narcissism. Reik believed that genuine self-regard was the ultimate basis for developing the capacity to love.\"\" At times Reik seems to defend women, at times to critique them. Yet he writes with sympathy and understanding. He challenges other authorities who have written on the subject, but he also agrees with many of them. Love and Lustis civilized writing at its most provocative. Reik is authoritative, and his book reflects the glow of a rich personality. It is mellow, but uncompromising.\",['Theodor Reik'],Routledge,2017-07-13\n",

      "Removed line: Memories of the Future, [Novel],\"Longlisted for the 2020 Andrew Carnegie Medals for Excellence A provocative, exuberant novel about time, memory, desire, and the imagination from the internationally bestselling and prizewinning author of The Blazing World, Memories of the Future tells the story of a young Midwestern woman's first year in New York City in the late 1970s and her obsession with her mysterious neighbor, Lucy Brite. As she listens to Lucy through the thin walls of her dilapidated building, S.H., aka \"\"Minnesota,\"\" transcribes her neighbor's bizarre and increasingly ominous monologues in a notebook, along with sundry other adventures, until one frightening night when Lucy bursts into her apartment on a rescue mission. Forty years later, S.H., now a veteran author, discovers her old notebook, as well as early drafts of a never-completed novel while moving her aging mother from one facility to another. Ingeniously juxtaposing the various texts, S.H. measures what she remembers against what she wrote that year and has since forgotten to create a dialogue between selves across decades. The encounter both collapses time and reframes its meanings in the present. Elaborately structured, intellectually rigorous, urgently paced, poignant, and often wildly funny, Memories of the Future brings together themes that have made Hustvedt among the most celebrated novelists working today: the fallibility of memory; gender mutability; the violence of patriarchy; the vagaries of perception; the ambiguous borders between sensation and thought, sanity and madness; and our dependence on primal drives such as sex, love, hunger, and rage.\",['Siri Hustvedt'],Simon and Schuster,2019-03-19\n",

      "Removed line: The autobiography of a hunted priest,,\"Truth is stranger than fiction. And nowhere in literature is it so apparent as in this classic work, \"\"The Autobiography of a Hunted Priest.\"\" This autobiography of a Jesuit priest in Elizabethan England is a most remarkable document and John Gerard, its author, a most remarkable priest in a time when to be a Catholic in England courted imprisonment and torture; to be a priest was treason by act of Parliament. Smuggled into England after his ordination and dumped on a Norfolk beach at night, Fr. Gerard disguised himself as a country gentleman and traveled about the country saying Mass, preaching and ministering to the faithful in secret always in constant danger. The houses in which he found shelter were frequently raided by priest hunters; priest-holes, hide-outs and hair-breadth escapes were part of his daily life. He was finally caught and imprisoned, and later removed to the infamous Tower of London where he was brutally tortured. The stirring account of his escape, by means of a rope thrown across the moat, is a daring and magnificent climax to a true story which, for sheer narrative power and interest, far exceeds any fiction. Here is an accurate and compelling picture of England when Catholics were denied their freedom to worship and endured vicious persecution and often martyrdom. But more than the story of a single priest, \"\"The Autobiography of a Hunted Priest\"\" epitomizes the constant struggle of all human beings through the ages to maintain their freedom. It is a book of courage and of conviction whose message is most timely for our age.\",['John Gerard'],Ignatius Press,2012\n",

This brilliant woman reporter, greatly admired by the fighting men, has dodged bullets with troops on the line, has asked neither favor nor privilege for herself, and has been commended publicly for bravery in helping grievously wounded men under fire. This is her up-front, personal report of the human side of the war. With the discerning eye of the expert reporter and the sympathy of a woman living through the agony of her countrymen, Miss Higgins tells the whole story of the bitter Korean campaign: young, green troops maturing in battle, Communist bullets kicking over the coffeepot at breakfast, the initial inadequacy of American arms, and the terrible price in men we are paying for unpreparedness. Miss Higgins also sketches brilliant thumbnail portraits of Generals MacArthur Walker, and Dean, and of many line and staff officers as well as GIs. In WAR IN KOREA she has written a tremendously compelling book that calls a spade a spade as it reveals the hell and heroism of an ordeal which compares to Valley Forge in the annals of American fighting men.

A magical, fable-like Christmas story from Cecelia Ahern, the celebrated New York Times bestselling author of P.S. I Love You and Thanks for the Memories. Extremely successful executive Lou Suffern is always overstretched, immune to the holiday spirit that delights everyone around him. The classic workaholic who never has a moment to spare, he is always multitasking while shortchanging his devoted wife and their adorable children. And ever since he started competing for a big promotion, he has barely seen his family at all. One frigid morning in an uncharacteristic burst of generosity, he buys a cup of coffee for Gabe, a homeless man huddled outside his office building. Inspired by his own unexpected act of kindness, Lou decides to prolong his charitable streak and contrives to get Gabe a job in his company's mailroom. But when Gabe begins to meddle in Lou's life, the helping hand appears to be a serious mistake. Gabe seems to know more about Lou than Lou does about himself, and, perhaps more disturbingly, Gabe always seems to be in two places at once. With Lou's personal and professional fates at important crossroads and Christmas looming, Gabe resorts to some unorthodox methods to show his stubborn patron what truly matters and how precious the gift of time is. But can he help him fix what's broken before it's too late?\",['Cecelia Ahern'],Harper Collins,2009-11-03\n",

Meet man as he really is: relative to the apes, stripped of his veneer as we see him courting, making love, sleeping, socialising, grooming, playing. Zoologist Desmond Morris's classic takes its place alongside Darwin's Origin of the Species, presenting man not as a fallen angel, but as a risen ape, remarkable in his resilience, energy and imagination, yet an animal nonetheless, in danger of forgetting his origins. With its penetrating insights on man's beginnings, sex life, habits and our astonishing bonds to the animal kingdom, The Naked Ape is a landmark, at once provocative, compelling and timeless.

Aries traces the evolution of the concept of childhood from the end of the Middle Ages, when the child was regarded as a small adult, to the present child-centered society, by means of diaries, paintings, games, and school curricula. Ironically, he finds that individualism, far from triumphing in our time, has been held in check by the family, and that the increasing power of the tightly-knit family circle has flourished at the expense of the rich-textured communal society of earlier times.

Missionaries From Communist China,\"As Isobel Kuhn states in the introduction, the purpose of this book is not to simply tell another story of the trials that Christians and missionaries faced under communism in China. Its true purpose is to describe God's provision for His children that allows them to \"\"put forth green leaves when all others around are dried up and dying from the drought.\"\" This book tells the tale of Arthur Mathews and his young family, who were missionaries with China Inland Mission in the 1950s. In 1951, China Inland Mission called for an evacuation of all its missionaries in China due to the oppression of the communist leaders there. Two years later, Arthur Mathews finally made it out to Hong Kong, after enduring torture and starvation. Yet his faith remained strong. What gave Mathews such strong faith? What enabled him and his wife to endure what they went through? Isobel Kuhn tells a compelling tale, based on Mathews' own letters, about the Source of his strength: God and God alone. God continually showed Himself faithful to Arthur and Wilda Mathews. Though Arthur and Wilda were unable to do the work they felt called to do, God showed that through their hardships He was more than enough for his children. The enduring faith of the Mathews family was a legacy of incalculable worth to the native Chinese church. As Kuhn asks, \"\"What more potent message could God have given these people? No wonder He deliberately sealed the lips of His servants, confined their hands and their feet, and then poured His life through them that the Chinese church might see and might desire ... Was God wrong to do this? In the farthest, most inland part of that great land was God unfair to ask two corns of wheat to die in this world's comforts that others might see for two long years (not just two days: God gave them a good stretch of testing time) how He is sufficient for all these things? He sent them to serve by life and so sealed their lips. It was a much more potent message.\"\" God is the true source of life, and God will keep His children even to the end. He kept Arthur and Wilda Mathews, and He will keep you too. This story is an incredible reminder of the truth of God's sustenance and life. - Publisher.\",['Isobel Kuhn'],Chicago : Moody Press,1957\n",

For this second edition, Smith Brindle has added a new chapter reviewing developments over the decade since first publication. He discusses the decline of experimentalism and the reaction against increasing cerebralism and complexity as variously illustrated by the more recent works ofStockhausen, the minimalist works of Reich and Glass, and the partial return to romanticism. He also reviews the technological revolution which has taken place in computer music and concludes that the future of music will for the time being be most closely associated with technological change anddevelopment, rather than with radical changes in compositional techniques.\",['Reginald Smith Brindle'],Oxford [Oxfordshire] , [Toronto] : Oxford University Press,1987\n",

      "Removed line: Banishment,\"Banishing troublesome and deviant people from society was common in the early modern period. Many European countries removed their paupers, convicted criminals, rebels and religious dissidents to remote communities or to their colonies where they could be simultaneously punished and, perhaps, contained and reformed. Under British rule, poor Irish, Scottish Jacobites, English criminals, Quakers, gypsies, Native Americans, the Acadian French in Canada, rebellious African slaves, or vulnerable minorities like the Jews of St. Eustatius, were among those expelled and banished to another place. This book explores the legal and political development of this forced migration, focusing on the British Atlantic world between 1600 and 1800. The territories under British rule were not uniform in their policies, and not all practices were driven by instructions from London, or based on a clear legal framework. Using case studies of legal and political strategies from the Atlantic world, and drawing on accounts of collective experiences and individual narratives, the authors explore why victims were chosen for banishment, how they were transported and the impact on their lives. The different contexts of such banishment - internal colonialism ethnic and religious prejudice, suppression of religious or political dissent, or the savageries of war in Europe or the colonies - are examined to establish to what extent displacement, exile and removal were fundamental to the early British Empire.\",\"['Peter Rushton', 'Gwenda Morgan']\",A&amp,C Black,2013-06-20\n",

      "Removed line: Hans Hofmann,,\"The career of the German-American painter and educator Hans Hofmann (1880-1966) describes the arc of artistic modernism from pre-World War I Munich and Paris to mid twentieth-century Greenwich Village. His career also traces the transatlantic engagement of modern painting with the materials of its own making, a relationship that is perhaps still not completely understood. In these interrelated narratives, Hofmann is a central protagonist, providing a vital link between nineteenth- and twentieth-century art practice and between European and American modernism. The remarkable vitality of his later work affords insight not only into the style but also the literal substance of this formative period of artistic and material innovation. This richly illustrated book, the fourth in the Getty Conservation Institute's Artist's Materials series, presents a thorough examination of Hofmann's late-career materials. Initial chapters present an informative overview of Hofmann's life and work in Europe and America and discuss his crucial role in the development of Abstract Expressionism. Subsequent chapters present a detailed analysis of Hofmann's materials and techniques and explore the relationship of the artist's mature palette to shifts in the style and aging characteristics of his paintings. The book concludes with lessons for the conservation of modernist paintings generally, and particularly those that incorporate both traditional and modern paint media. This book will be of value to conservators, art historians, conservation scientists, and general readers with an interest in modern art.\",['Dawn V. Rogala'],Getty Publications,2016-08-01\n",

As this book reveals, his vision was much more complex and interesting. He hoped that machines would release people from relentless and repetitive drudgery in order to achieve more creative pursuits. At the same time he realized the danger of dehumanizing and displacement.

      "Removed line: City in the Sky, The Rise and Fall of the World Trade Center,\"The definitive biography of the iconic skyscrapers and the ambitions that shaped them--from their dizzying rise to their unforgettable fall More than a year after the nation began mourning the lives lost in the attacks on the World Trade Center, it became clear that something else was being mourned: the towers themselves. They were the biggest and brashest icons that New York, and possibly America, has ever produced--magnificent giants that became intimately familiar around the globe. Their builders were possessed of a singular determination to create wonders of capitalism as well as engineering, refusing to admit defeat before natural forces, economics, or politics. No one knows the history of the towers better than New York Times reporters James Glanz and Eric Lipton. In a vivid, brilliantly researched narrative, the authors re-create David Rockefeller's ambition to rebuild lower Manhattan, the spirited opposition of local storeowners and powerful politicians, the bold structural innovations that later determined who lived and died, master builder Guy Tozzoli's last desperate view of the towers on September 11, and the charged and chaotic recovery that could have unraveled the secrets of the buildings' collapse but instead has left some enduring mysteries.

Unlike studies of talk shows that decry debased cultural standards and impoverished political consciousness, Oprah Winfrey and the Glamour of Misery asks us to rethink our perceptions of culture in general and popular culture in particular. At a time when crises of morality, beliefs, value systems, and personal worth dominate both public and private spheres, Oprah's emergence as a cultural form -- the Oprah persona -- becomes clearer, as she successfully reiterates some of our most pressing moral questions. Drawing on nearly one hundred show transcripts; a year and a half of watching the show regularly; and analysis of magazine articles, several biographies, O Magazine, Oprah Book Club novels, self-help manuals promoted on the show, and hundreds of discussions on the Oprah Winfrey Web site, Illouz takes the Oprah industry seriously, revealing it to be a multilayered \"\"textual structure\"\" that initiates, stages, and performs narratives of suffering and self-improvement that resonate with a wide audience and challenge traditional models of cultural analysis. This book looks closely at Oprah's method and her message, and in the process reconsiders popular culture and the tools we use to understand it.\",['Eva Illouz'],,2003\n",

MASTERS OF DECEIT is a powerful and informative book--a firsthand account of American communism from its beginnings to the present, written by a man more intimately familiar with the complete story than any other American. Mr. Hoover shows the day-to-day operations of the Communist Party, USA: who the communists are, what they claim, why people become communists and why some break away. He describes life within the Party, communist strategy and tactics, methods of mass agitation and underground infiltration, espionage, sabotage, and its treatment of minorities. The picture of what life in this country would be under communism (toward which thousands of misguided Americans actually are working now!) is vivid and shocking. The forceful, driving message of this book is clarified with many incidents and anecdotes, definitions of communist terms, key dates, and a list of international communist organizations and publications which illustrate the communist Trojan horse in action. And it concretely outlines just what you can do now to combat the evils of the \"\"false religion\"\" of communism, so that you can stay free.

In 2001 he completely revised and reworked this hugely acclaimed book, adding new sections, substantially reworking text, and bringing the story up-to-date with Dylan's explosive career in 2000. Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited follows the story of Dylan from his humble beginnings in Minnesota to his arrival in New York in 1961, his subsequent rise in the folk pantheon of Greenwich Village in the early '60s, and his cataclysmic folk-rock metamorphosis at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965. In the succeeding eighteen months, Dylan released Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde, and embarked on the legendary 1966 World Tour that culminated with an unforgettable concert at the Royal Albert Hall. Heylin details it all, along with the true story of Dylan's motorcycle accident, his remarkable reemergence in the mid-'70s, the only exacting account of his controversial conversion to born-again Christianity, the Neverending Tour, and yet another incredible Dylan resurgence with his 1997 Grammy Album of the Year Award-winning Time Out of Mind.

      "Removed line: All quiet on the western front,,\"Considered by many the greatest war novel of all time, All Quiet on the Western Front is Erich Maria Remarque's masterpiece of the German experience during World War I. I am young, I am twenty years old; yet I know nothing of life but despair, death, fear, and fatuous superficiality cast over an abyss of sorrow. . . . This is the testament of Paul B?umer, who enlists with his classmates in the German army during World War I. They become soldiers with youthful enthusiasm. But the world of duty, culture, and progress they had been taught breaks in pieces under the first bombardment in the trenches. Through years of vivid horror, Paul holds fast to a single vow: to fight against the principle of hate that meaninglessly pits young men of the same generation but different uniforms against one another . . . if only he can come out of the war alive. \"\"The world has a great writer in Erich Maria Remarque. He is a craftsman of unquestionably first rank, a man who can bend language to his will. Whether he writes of men or of inanimate nature, his touch is sensitive, firm, and sure.\"\"-The New York Times Book Review\",['Erich Maria Remarque'],Random House Trade Paperbacks,1996-09-29\n",

During the reign of King James I a man must know his enemies to survive and Shadwell is one of Gresham's best sources. Then Shadwell is discovered brutally murdered. And before Gresham is able to establish why, he is summoned by the man he fears most: Robert Cecil, the King's Machiavellian Chief Secretary. Cecil wants Gresham to investigate Sir Francis Bacon's private life.

Operating along the Natchez Trace, an overland trading and postal-rider route that in places was barely a trail, the outlaws preyed upon the traffic along this line. Their plans were laid in the dives under the bluffs of the river towns--Natchez and Vicksburg and as far south as New Orleans. By far the bloodiest were the Harpes, who were capable of spectacular murders solely to amuse their comrades. Another gang of outlaws under John Murrell even threatened national stability for a time in his plot to steal slaves and organize insurrection in order to disorganize the government and establish his own state. This conspiracy was discovered and defeated by a store clerk who joined the outlaws and lived several perilous months among them. He was almost hung by Murrell's secret partisans among the \"\"respectable\"\" elements. After the overthrow of the \"\"outlaw empire\"\" in 1885, the scene shifted: the frontier advanced; outlaw violence changed its forms, but it never again reached the terrible and magnificent range of the \"\"outlaw years.\"\"\",['Robert Coates'],Pelican Publishing,2010-09-23\n",

      "Removed line: The Appalachian frontier,: America's first surge westward,\"John A. Caruso's The Appalachian Frontier is a stirring drama of the beginnings of American westward expansion. It traces the advance of the frontier in the area between the Ohio and Tennessee rivers and the development of the American character-those attitudes toward personal liberty and dignity that have come to epitomize our national ideal. The Appalachian Frontier is no mere catalog of facts; it is a recreation of life. Not until about 1650, more than a generation after the first English settlements were established on the eastern coast, did organized bands of white explorers, hunters and fur trappers venture very far into the trackless back country claimed by the British Crown. Beginning with those earliest scouting parties The Appalachian Frontier presses with the pioneers past the Fall Line and the pine barrens into the Piedmont of Virginia, on through gaps in the Blue Ridge Mountains to the Great Valley of the Appalachians, through the Great Valley to the jagged peaks of the Allegheny Front and, finally, over those peaks into the rich country of Kentucky and Tennessee. As the frontiersman advances he discovers that the rules prevailing in the European-dominated eastern settlements do not apply in his new situation. Thus we see him formulate the rudiments of a law of his own. As his life grows more complex, he frames compacts and, finally; constitutions peculiarly adapted to the exigencies of frontier living. We are present at the inception of the fluid democracy that later engulfed the more stable coastal colonies and ultimately came to characterize the government of the United States. The story closes, quite properly, with the admission of Tennessee into the Union in 1796. In John A. Caruso's bright, informal, sometimes almost racy telling of the tale, historical personages emerge as real people whose triumphs and heartaches we share, with whose deficiencies and inadequacies we sympathize, and in whose hours of nobility we rejoice.\",['Dr. John A.

After he studied interior and industrial design for eight years at the School of Commercial Art in Zurich, Switzerland, from 1962 till 1970, he was soon gaining attention as an independent artist, with endeavors ranging from surrealistic dream landscapes created with a spray gun and stencils, to album cover designs for famous pop stars, and sculptures. In addition, Gigerrsquo;s multi-faceted career includes designing two bars, located in Tokyo and Chur, as well as work on various film projectsmdash;his creation of the set design and title figure for Ridley Scottrsquo;s film Alien won him not only international fame but also an Academy Award for Best Achievement for Visual Effects (1980).

He first received acclaim in the 1960s with his airbrushed fantasies of post-apocalyptic creatures and landscapes, and rose to fame through high profile movie work, most notably the creation of the monster in Alien, which won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.

Through extensive interviews with residents as well as Dr. Mills, his staff and other professionals, a very compelling and moving portrait is painted of how two low-income, inner-city housing projects replete with violence, crack, drug gangs, abuse, welfare dependency and hopelessness were completely turned around within two-and-a-half years. This book shows how people who lived in the most difficult circumstances were reached, came to find hope and changed their lives. \"\"In all my years in prevention I have never seen this level of change in people \"\" It is a truly inspirational story. The lives of people on whom society has given up were completely turned around. At the same time it is a sociological study. It shows how a new and different inside-out, spiritual paradigm, which on the surface seems too simple and backwards to possibly work in such overwhelming conditions, can produce incredible results and create changes in people's lives that stand head and shoulders above the traditional outside-in paradigm for prevention, human services, social work, community development and education.

Seventeen-year-old Gothic novel aficionado Catherine Morland and family friends Mr. and Mrs. Allen are visiting Bath. It is Catherine's first visit and she makes new friends, such as Isabella Thorpe.

      "Removed line: The edge of objectivity, an essay in the history of scientific ideas,\"Originally published in 1960, The Edge of Objectivity helped to establish the history of science as a full-fledged academic discipline. In the mid-1950s, a young professor at Princeton named Charles Gillispie began teaching Humanities 304, one of the first undergraduate courses offered anywhere in the world on the history of science. From Galileo's analysis of motion to theories of evolution and relativity, Gillispie introduces key concepts, individuals, and themes. The Edge of Objectivity arose out of this course. It must have been a lively class. The Edge of Objectivity is pointed, opinionated, and selective. Even at six hundred pages, the book is, as the title suggests, an essay. Gillispie is unafraid to rate Mendel higher than Darwin, Maxwell above Faraday. Full of wry turns of phrase, the book effectively captures people and places. And throughout the book, Gillispie pushes an argument. He views science as the progressive development of more objective, detached, mathematical ways of viewing the world, and he orchestrates his characters and ideas around this theme. This edition of Charles Coulston Gillispie's landmark book introduces a new generation of readers to his provocative and enlightening account of the advancement of scientific thought over the course of four centuries. Since the original publication of The Edge of Objectivity, historians of science have focused increasingly on the social context of science rather than its internal dynamics, and they have frequently viewed science more as a threatening instance of power than as an accumulation of knowledge. Nevertheless, Gillispie's book remains a sophisticated, fast-moving, idiosyncratic account of the development of scientific ideas over four hundred years, by one of the founding intellects in the history of science. Featuring a new foreword by Theodore Porter, who places the work in its intellectual context and the development of the field, this edition of The Edge of Objectivity is a monumental work by one of the founding intellects of the history of science.\",['Charles Coulston Gillispie'],Princeton University Press,2016-08-23\n",
      "Removed line: One who came back,: The diary of a Jewish survivor,\"In December 1941, the SS deported twenty-three-year old Josef Katz from his home in L?beck, Germany, to the Riga ghetto. Over the next four years, he and thousands of other Jews were subjected to unrelenting brutality in internment ghettos and concentration camps. One Who Came Back is an unflinching account of Katz's coming through each day's terror and its constant threat of death. Liberated in 1945, and surviving a death march back to Germany, he began this diary in 1946, finishing it a year later in New York where he arrived with his wife Irene, also a survivor of Riga. One Who Came Back has been acknowledged by historians, including Martin Gilbert and Leni Yahil, as a significant contribution to our understanding of what slave laborers endured in Nazi camps during the war. 1973 Herzl Press 1976 German-language edition Published by Dryad Press in association with University of Wisconsin Press\",['Josef Katz'],University of Wisconsin Press,2006\n",

Here, too, is a graphic picture of the American underworld that managed the fix, the deeply shocked newspapermen who uncovered the story, and the war-exhausted nation that turned with relief and pride to the Series, only to be rocked by the scandal. Far more than a superbly told baseball story, this is a compelling slice of American history in the aftermath of World War I and at the cusp of the Roaring Twenties.\",['Eliot Asinof'],Holt Paperbacks,2011-04-01\n",

She's been lying to everybody, including herself, about who she really was.But no matter what she does, she just can't seem to live up to their expectations. And then she got fed up and decided to let loose. For just one night. She left her eyeglasses, flat shoes, long skirt and knitted sweater behind. In high heels and a dress that accented her long legs and curves, she went to a club by herself and decided to find out what it was like to have a good time.Her night couldn't even be more perfect when Justin Adams, the city's most sought after bachelor, a.k.a. most notorious playboy fell prey to the charms she didn't even know she possessed. Justin was every girl's dream boat, but he never committed to a woman. He didn't date and didn't do relationships. So, Adrienne thought after that night, she didn't have to deal with him again. He would forget about her and her secret night of fun was safe with him.But what she did not expect was that Justin wasn't about to let her go that easily.

Getting Over Yourself is a call for Christians to reject these hollow messages of personal prosperity and to return to the humble truths of the gospel. You'll learn how to identify this insidious, popular theology in culture and churches and examine its devastating effects.

In laymen terms, our intelligence is composed of two halves, the first being genetic, the second being environmental (e.g., diet, sleep, sociability, etc.), and these two halves come together to form our current situation. Therefore, effects on either of these halves can help make or break our grades. The only way to improve your situation is to learn how to make your brain happy and comfortable, because when youre sad or stressed you will not function as well. In fact, some people are physically disfigured to a certain degree because they endured so much trial. In this state of mind, motor skills are frustrated and do not function like they should. Also, because of provoking anxiety, ability to fight disease is infringed. Above all, your focus, drive to succeed, and mental activity are all incredibly bankrupt.

      "Removed line: The nature of the physical world (The Gifford lectures),In these lectures the author Eddington discusses some of the results of modern study of the physical world which give most food for philosophic thought. This will include new conceptions in science and also new knowledge. In both respects we are led to think of the material universe in a way very different from that prevailing at the classical physics. This book is substantially the course of Gifford Lectures which the author Eddington delivered in the University of Edinburgh in January to March 1927. It treats of the philosophical outcome of the great changes of scientific thought. The theory of relativity and the quantum theory have led to strange new conceptions of the physical world, the progress of the principles of thermodynamics has wrought more gradual but no less profound change.,['Sir Arthur Eddington'],BoD - Books on Demand,2021-03-18\n",

      "Removed line: Mosquitoes,,\"Mosquitoes of the Southeastern United States is a full-color, highly illustrated guide to the sixty-four known species of mosquitoes in eleven genera that populate the South--from the Gulf Coastal states to the Carolinas. In addition to detailed and fully illustrated identification keys for both larvae and adults, Mosquitoes of the Southeastern United Statesincludes information on the mosquito's lifecycle, interaction with humans, and biological diversity in the southeast. This area of the country has a rich mosquito fauna with diverse species ranging from the tiny pitcher plant mosquito to the brilliantly colored cannibal mosquito. Close-up photographs of live adults showcase their widely varied and beautiful bodies while remarkable images made with the aid of a microaquarium reveal the differences in larval stages of the subjects. For each species described, Nathan D. Burkett-Cadena provides biological information including distribution maps, habitat associations of the larvae and adults, range of animals fed upon, and importance from a medical standpoint. This book's usefulness to mosquito control programs in the Southeast and beyond cannot be overstated. Not only for native species, but for new species introduced from exotic locales, mosquitoes must be properly identified in order to know how best to control them. This volume will also be valuable to medical and public health specialists working on mosquito-borne diseases, such as malaria, dengue, yellow fever, West Nile virus, and filariasis. Mosquitoes of the Southeastern United States is the first guide to integrate full-color photography, illustrated keys, and current information on the biology of mosquitoes into one definitive resource.\",['Nathan D.

      "Removed line: Viva Kennedy: Mexican Americans In Search of Camelot (Texas A&M, Southwestern Studies),\"For a few brief months during the presidential campaign of 1960, Mexican Americans caught a glimpse of their own Camelot in the promise of John F. Kennedy. Grassroots \"\"Viva Kennedy Clubs\"\" sprang up not only in the southwestern United States but also across California and the upper Midwest to help elect the young Catholic standard bearer. The leaders of the Viva Kennedy Clubs were confident and hopeful that their participation in American democracy would mark the beginning of the end of discrimination, violence, and poverty in the barrio. Although the dream of attaching their own Camelot to Kennedy's ultimately ended in disappointment, these participatory efforts contributed to an identity-building process for Mexican Americans that led to greater emphasis on Americanization for some and to the more radical rhetoric of the Chicano Movement for others. In \"\"Viva Kennedy,\"\" Ignacio M. Garcia surveys the background, development, and evolution of the Viva Kennedy Clubs and their post-election incarnation as PASO, the Political Association of Spanish-Speaking Organizations. He argues that patriotic fervor of the 1940s and postwar economic expansion spurred middle-class Mexican Americans to strive for full inclusion in American society. Ironically, those involved in the Viva Kennedy movement showed their militancy in fighting discrimination even as they upheld America's conservative values. They believed that discrimination could be overcome through government actions that recognized their civil rights and through their own political participation. Garcia describes the post-election problems of the Viva Kennedy reformers, who first saw the Kennedy administration ignore its campaign promises to them and then encountered their own factional squabbles, chronic funding problems, and a growing unease among Anglo Americans wary of Mexican American political power. Based on research and interviews with key leaders of the Viva Kennedy movement such as Ed Idar, Jr., Edward R. Roybal, and Albert Pena, Jr., this study unveils a portrait of a people in transition and provides a nuanced picture of twentieth-century Mexican American history.\",['Ignacio M.

It is the story of an incredible journey, too - deep into the heart of British India, and the India and Sindh of today.

      "Removed line: CLINICAL VERSUS STATISTICAL PREDICTION, A THEORETICAL ANALYSIS AND A REVIEW OF THE EVIDENCE.,\"Clinical versus Statistical Prediction is Paul Meehl's famous examination of benefits and disutilities related to the different ways of combining information to make predictions. It is a clarifying analysis as relevant today as when it first appeared. A major methodological problem for clinical psychology concerns the relation between clinical and actuarial methods of arriving at diagnoses and predicting behavior. Without prejudging the question as to whether these methods are fundamentally different, we can at least set forth the obvious distinctions between them in practical applications. The problem is to predict how a person is going to behave: What is the most accurate way to go about this task? Clinical versus Statistical Prediction offers a penetrating and thorough look at the pros and cons of human judgment versus actuarial integration of information as applied to the prediction problem. Widely considered the leading text on the subject, Paul Meehl's landmark analysis is reprinted here in its entirety, including his updated preface written forty-two years after the first publication of the book. This classic work is a must-have for students and practitioners interested in better understanding human behavior, for anyone wanting to make the most accurate decisions from all sorts of data, and for those interested in the ethics and intricacies of prediction. As Meehl puts it, \"\"When one is dealing with human lives and life opportunities, it is immoral to adopt a mode of decision-making which has been demonstrated repeatedly to be either inferior in success rate or, when equal, costlier to the client or the taxpayer.\"\"\",['Paul Meehl'],,2013-02\n",

As a result there has been a wealth of new research in this area. Complementing Woodhead's best-selling Hygiene in the food industry, which reviews current best practice in hygienic design and operation, Handbook of hygiene control in the food industry provides a comprehensive summary of the key trends and issues in food hygiene research. Developments go fast: results of the R&D meanwhile have been applied or are being implemented as this book goes to print. Part one reviews research on the range of contamination risks faced by food processors. Building on this foundation, Part two discusses current trends in the design both of buildings and types of food processing equipment, from heating and packaging equipment to valves, pipes and sensors. Key issues in effective hygiene management are then covered in part three, from risk analysis, good manufacturing practice and standard operating procedures (SOPs) to improving cleaning and decontamination techniques. The final part of the book reviews developments in ways of monitoring the effectiveness of hygiene operations, from testing surface cleanability to sampling techniques and hygiene auditing. Like Hygiene in the food industry, this book is a standard reference for the food industry in ensuring the highest standards of hygiene in food production.

Passing through the straights of Dover, the ships faced everything the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy could throw at them. In a dramatic running fight, the ships managed to sail right under the nose of history's greatest maritime nation to reach the safety of Germany. The brilliantly executed operation brought great humiliation to the British - Hitler, who had developed the plan, had judged perfectly the reaction of the British command to the Channel Dash. Repositioned, these fast, heavily armed ships went on to threaten the Allied Arctic convoys that kept Russia in the war at Stalingrad.

'A man is not an orange. You can't eat the fruit and throw the peel away' Willy Loman is on his last legs. Failing at his job, dismayed at his the failure of his sons, Biff and Happy, to live up to his expectations, and tortured by his jealousy at the success and happiness of his neighbour Charley and his son Bernard, Willy spirals into a well of regret, reminiscence, and A scathing indictment of the ultimate failure of the American dream, and the empty pursuit of wealth and success, is a harrowing journey. In creating Willy Loman, his destructively insecure anti-hero, Miller defined his aim as being 'to set forth what happens when a man does not have a grip on the forces of life'. Arthur Miller (1915-2005), American dramatist, was born in New York City. In 1938 Miller won awards for his comedy The Grass Still Grows. His major achievement was Death of a Salesman, which won the 1949 Pulitzer Prize for drama and the 1949 New York Drama Critics' Circle Award. The Crucible was aimed at the widespread congressional investigation of subversive activities in the US; the drama won the 1953 Tony Award.

      "Removed line: Grace and glory / E.L. Mascall ,,\"Charles Miller's rigorous and sensitive examination of Richard Hooker's theology makes a valuable addition to the field of study of the cleric, one of the founding theologians of modern Anglicanism. Miller examines Hooker's works in detail, leading the reader through different facets of his vision of God: creation, Scripture, the sacraments, and practices of Christian devotion. Hooker's theology challenges an increasingly time-bound, relativistic approach to doctrine and truth; his sources were as wide, as ancient, and as modern as Hooker could make them. Miller's thoughtful analysis is informed throughout by an understanding of the context of Hooker's theological development against the backdrop of continental Calvinism and the remnants of Roman Catholicism in England. The growth of interest in Hooker among specialists has been accompanied by an abandonment of the serious study of Hooker's thought among theological students, clergy and theologians. Miller's work addresses thislack; Hooker's insights must not be forgotten in the daily distribution of theological food to Christian people. A study which attunes readers to Hooker's particular theological 'voice' and teaches its value both in his own context and as a present-day interlocutor, this volume will be of great interest to Christians and theological students alike.\",['Charles Miller'],ISD LLC,2013-07-25\n",

      "Removed line: The ethics of ambiguity,,\"From the groundbreaking author of The Second Sex comes a radical argument for ethical responsibility and freedom. In this classic introduction to existentialist thought, French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir's The Ethics of Ambiguity simultaneously pays homage to and grapples with her French contemporaries, philosophers Jean-Paul Sartre and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, by arguing that the freedoms in existentialism carry with them certain ethical responsibilities. De Beauvoir outlines a series of \"\"ways of being\"\" (the adventurer, the passionate person, the lover, the artist, and the intellectual), each of which overcomes the former's deficiencies, and therefore can live up to the responsibilities of freedom. Ultimately, de Beauvoir argues that in order to achieve true freedom, one must battle against the choices and activities of those who suppress it. The Ethics of Ambiguity is the book that launched Simone de Beauvoir's feminist and existential philosophy. It remains a concise yet thorough examination of existence and what it means to be human.\",\"['Simone de Beauvoir', 'Bernard Frechtman']\",Open Road Media,2018-05\n",

In this paper, we review the recent empirical and theoretical literature that motivate this paradigm shift. The renewed interest in hysteresis has been sparked by the persistence of the Global Financial Crisis and fears of a slow recovery from the Covid-19 crisis. The findings of the recent literature have far-reaching conceptual and policy implications. In recessions, monetary and fiscal policies need to be more active to avoid the permanent scars of a downturn.

In the poignant and humorous essay On Being Ill, Virginia Woolf observes that though illness is a part of every human being's experience, it is not celebrated as a subject of great literature in the way that love and war are embraced by writers and readers. We must, Woolf says, invent a new language to describe pain. Illness, she observes, enhances our perceptions and reduces self-consciousness; it is \"\"the great confessional.\"\" Woolf discusses the taboos associated with illness and she explores how it changes our relationship to the world around us. Notes from Sick Rooms addresses illness from the caregiver's perspective. With clarity, humor, and pathos, Julia Stephen offers concrete and useful information to caregivers today. Originally published by Paris Press in 2002 as On Being Ill, this paperback edition includes an introduction to Notes from Sick Rooms and to Julia Stephen by Mark Hussey, the founding editor of Woolf Studies Annual, and a poignant afterword by Rita Charon, MD, the founder of the field of Narrative Medicine. Hermione Lee's brilliant introduction to On Being Ill is a superb introduction to Virginia Woolf's life and writing.

      "Removed line: A Ringing Glass: The Life of Rainer Maria Rilke (Clarendon Paperbacks),\"Rainer Maria Rilke (1875-1926) is widely regarded as the greatest lyric poet of this century. His major achievements--the New poems, the Sonnets to Orpheus, and the incomparable Duino Elegies--had a powerful impact on European literature and have been the subject of intense scrutiny and increasing acclaim since the poet's death. Only in recent years, however, with the emergence of key documentary material, has it become possible to present the full story of Rilke's life. In A Ringing Glass, Donald Prater's aim is not to add another stone to the mounting edifice of critical interpretation, but to provide a portrait of the man hmself, and to show the background in which Rilke's extraordinary vision developed. And it is an extraordinary background. Rilke's nomadic existence led him from his birthplace in Prague through Germany, Russian, Spain, Italy, France, and finally Switzerland, He visited Tolstoy at Yasnaya Polyana, acted for a time as secretary to Rodin, and was friend of Ramain Rolland, Leonid Pasternak, and Walter Rathenau. He was the protege of Princess Marie von Thurn und Taxis and the lover Lou Andreas-Salome and Baladine Klossawska (of whose son, the painter Balthus, he was an early patron). Financially and emotionally, Rilke needed these associations; yet he dedicated himself fully to his art and remained single-minded in his search for the solitude it required. In his correspondence, from which Prater draws extensively, Rilke reveals the tragic conflict between his needs as a man and his goals as a poet. \"\"This above all,\"\" he wrote a younger colleague, \"\"ask yourself...must I write? Delve into yourself for a deep answer. And if this should be affirmative...then build your life according to this necessity.\"\" With this comprehensive biography, readers can themselves delve deeply into the life Rilke built, a life as courageous and rare as the poetry it left behind. About the Author: Donald Prater is the author of European of Yesterday, a biography of Stefan Zweig, and his edition of the Rilke-Zweig correspondence will appear shortly in Germany.

      "Removed line: The Otoes and Missourias,: A study of Indian removal and the legal aftermath,\"For seventy years, from about 1775 until 1845, Big Village was the principal settlement of the Omaha Indians. Situated on the Missouri River seventy-five miles above the present city of Omaha, it commanded a strategic location astride this major trade route to the northern plains. A host of traders and travelers, from Jean-Baptiste Truteau and James Mackay to Lewis and Clark and Father De Smet, left descriptions of the village. Although John Champe of the University of Nebraska carried out a comprehensive archaeological investigation of the site from 1939 to 1942 (the only intensive, systematic archaeological study of any Omaha site), the results of his work have heretofore remained unpublished. Now John M. O'Shea and John Ludwickson have combined Champe's findings with the major historical accounts of the Omahas, providing significant new insights into the course of Omaha history in the preservation period. The emphasis on material culture gives a unique view of the daily life of these people and illustrates clearly the integration of European trade items with traditional technologies. Here the fur trade is seen in a fresh perspective, that of the suppliers of furs and recipients of trade goods. An examination of Omaha demography rounds out this important new ethnohistorical sketch of the Omaha Indians.\",\"[\"\"John M. O'Shea\"\"]\",U of Nebraska Press,1992-01-01\n",

This definitive study takes readers into the cockpits and onto the flight decks of the versatile and hardy U.S. escort carriers (CVEs) to tell of their vital, yet little-known contribution to the anti-U-boat campaign. Sailing apart from the Allied convoys, the CVE captains had complete freedom of action and frequently took their ships on \"\"hunt and kill\"\" missions against the enemy. The German submarines were allowed no respite and no place to relax without the fear of discovery. World War II historian William Y'Blood explains that in the eighteen months between the spring of 1943, when the escort carriers began to prowl the Atlantic, to November 1944, the average number of U-boats in daily operation was reduced from 108 to a mere 31. Though land-based aircraft, various support groups, and the convoy system itself helped win the Battle of the Atlantic, the escort carrier groups' influence was profound. In addition to documenting the escort carriers' exciting operational history, the author also traces the CVE's development and construction and examines its tactical and strategic uses.\",\"[\"\"William T.

Incorporating minor corrections and a foreword by Professor Walter Welford FRS, this reissue of the 1957 edition provides a wealth of technical information and hands-on guidance gained from a lifetime of experience. Although some of the techniques have been replaced by more modern methods, this classic book is still a valuable source of practical assistance as well as being a pleasure to read. About the Author Frank Twyman was a skilled craftsman in all aspects of optics. He joined Otto Hilger in 1898 to work on the production of simple spectroscopes costing less than ?10 each. After the death of Otto Hilger, Twyman became Managing Director of Adam Hilger Ltd., a company known for the finest quality optical and mechanical work. He worked here from 1902 to 1946 and was very concerned with the practical aspects of instrument making; he designed many of the instruments himself and constantly strove to improve the techniques of optical grinding and polishing. In 1916 Twyman and Alfred Green, the foreman of the Hilger optical shops, patented the now-famous prism and lens testing interferometer that bears their names. Twyman also undertook fundamental studies in the annealing process for glass and invented new spectrophotometers and spectrographs.\",['Twyman F'],CRC Press,1988-01-01\n",

The probing introduction speaks for a new generation of young scholars as it discusses the initial impact and continuing relevance of Goodman's problematic love affair with the radical youth of the 1960s. Timely and compelling, Goodman's narrative reassesses what he considered a moral and spiritual upheaval comparable to the Protestant Reformation?\"\"the breakdown of belief, and the emergence of new belief, in sciences and professions, education, and civil legitimacy.\"\" With new analysis of 1960s activism, this survey shows that Goodman's prescient voice is as relevant today as it was four decades ago.\",['Paul Goodman'],Pm Press,2010\n",

HER ONLY CRIME WAS TO BE AN INDEPENDENT WOMAN When Mata Hari arrived in Paris she was penniless. Within months she was the most celebrated woman in the city. As a dancer, she shocked and delighted audiences; as a courtesan, she bewitched the era's richest and most powerful men. But as paranoia consumed a country at war, Mata Hari's lifestyle brought her under suspicion. In 1917, she was arrested in her hotel room on the Champs Elysees, and accused of espionage. Told in Mata Hari's voice through her final letter, The Spy is the unforgettable story of a woman who dared to defy convention and who paid the ultimate price.\",['Paulo Coelho'],Vintage,2016-11-22\n",

      "Removed line: Facing Reality, Philosophical Adventures By a Brain Scientist,\"The titling of this book - \"\"Facing Reality\"\" - came to me unbidden, presumably from my subconscious! But, when it came, it seemed to be right, because that essentially is what I am trying to do in this book. \"\" Facing\"\" is to be understood in the sense of \"\"looking at in a steadfast and unflinching manner\"\". It thus contrasts with \"\"Confronting\"\" which has the sense of \"\"looking at with hostility and defiance\"\". As I face life with its joys and its sorrows, its successes and its failures, its peace and its turmoil, my attitude is one of serene acceptance and gratitude and not one of angry and arrogant confrontation and rejection. The other component of the title - \"\"Reality\"\" - is the ultimate reality for each of us as conscious beings - our birth - our self-hood in its long stream of becoming throughout our life - our death and apparent annihilation. This is the Reality that we each of us must face if we are to live and adventure as free and responsible beings and not as mere playthings of chance and circumstance, going through a mean ingless farce from birth to death with the search ever for distraction and self-forgetfulness. As a brain scientist I have specialist knowledge of that wonderful part of the body that is alone concerned in the whole Iife-Iong interplay between the conscious self and the extern al world, including other selves.\",['J.

The documents, too, from which the doctrine is to be drawn, charmed my fancy by their endless variety, and lay always before me, even in sleep; for they are the tools in our hands, the bread in our basket, the transactions of the street, the farm, and the dwelling-house, greetings, relations, debts and credits, the influence of character, the nature and endowment of all men. It seemed to me, also, that in it might be shown men a ray of divinity, the present action of the soul of this world, clean from all vestige of tradition, and so the heart of man might be bathed by an inundation of eternal love, conversing with that which he knows was always and always must be, because it really is now. It appeared, moreover, that if this doctrine could be stated in terms with any resemblance to those bright intuitions in which this truth is sometimes revealed to us, it would be a star in many dark hours and crooked passages in our journey that would not suffer us to lose our way.Ralph Waldo EmersonLife Transformation Publishing / www.lifetransformationpublishing.com selected this book to publish because it was recommended by Napaloeon Hill who wrote Think and Grow Rich of which we have published also.

In this study, Peter Leithart's key insight reveals a prominent scriptural example of a liturgy that interprets God's commands for worship in ways for more biblically grounded than traditional regulativism allows.

      "Removed line: An anthology of world poetry,,\"This long-awaited, indispensable volume contains more than 1600 poems drawn from dozens of languages and cultures, and spans a period of more than 4000 years from ancient Sumer and Egypt to the late twentieth century. World Poetry encompasses the many realms of poetry -- poetry of all styles, of all eras, of all tongues: from the ancient epic of Gilgamesh and the Pharaoh Akhenaten's \"\"Hymn to the Sun\"\" to the haiku of Basho and the dazzling imagery of Li Po; from Vedic hymns to Icelandic sagas to the \"\"Carmina Burana\"\"; from the magnificence of Homer and Dante to the lyricism of Goethe and Verlaine; from the piercing insights of Rilke and Yeats to the revelatory verse of Emily Dickinson, Garcia Lorca, Derek Walcott, Seamus Heaney, and so many more. While World Poetry includes a generous selection of the best English-language verse from Chaucer to the present, it is designed to lay before the reader the best that all the world's cultures have to offer -- more than eighty percent of the book is poetry originally written in languages other than English and translated by some of the finest talents working today, many of them brilliant poets in their own right. This is no mere sampler: In choosing only works of the highest intrinsic quality, the editors have created a book that will surprise knowledgeable readers and lead newcomers to an understanding of the glories of world poetry that is our common heritage.\",\"['Katharine Washburn', 'Clifton Fadiman', 'John S.

      "Removed line: Existentialism and modern literature,: An essay in existential criticism,\"These three essays-originally written in the 1960s as lectures-show how novels, poems, and plays confront thephilosophicalcomplexities of humanity's existence. Our self-awareness-the very thing that makes us human-also makes us realize our powerlessness and the limitations of our existence. This concept is explored in this thought-provoking guide and provides a jumping off point for this treatise on existentialism and literature. Davis D. McElroy examines how modern art-the unharmonious, corrupt, dismal, and shattering effect of much of humanity's painting, music, and literature-can be traced to the existentialist view of existence. McElroy uses the works of such American authors as John Steinbeck, Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams, and William Faulkner-as well of those of Kafka and Ibsen-to show that literature is the work of desperate men, whose anguish and despair have driven them to see further and more clearly than is possible for most, and their warnings must be heeded. To be able to live in the chaos of the modern world, many authors have turned to existentialism as a guide, according to McElroy. Using T. S. Eliot's The Wasteland and his plays The Confidential Clerk and The Cocktail Party as examples, McElroy posits that these authors are ultimately teaching us that we must learn to live authentically, or we will not live at all; we must choose the good that is in us, or be engulfed in the evils that surround us. This is the simple message which modern writers-as well as the philosophers of existentialism-are trying so desperately to bring to our attention.\",['Davis Dunbar McElroy'],Open Road Media,2022-09-06\n",

      "Removed line: The Lost Colony of the Confederacy (Williams-Ford Texas A&M, University Military History Series),\"The Lost Colony of the Confederacy is the story of a grim, quixotic journey of twenty thousand Confederates to Brazil at the end of the American Civil War. Although it is not known exactly how many Confederates migrated to South America -- estimates range from eight thousand to forty thousand -- their departure was fueled by bitterness over a lost cause and a distaste for an oppressive victor. Encouraged by Emperor Dom Pedro, most of these exiles settled in Brazil. Although at the time of the Civil War the exodus was widely known and discussed as an indicator of the resentment against the northern invaders and the strict measures imposed by the federal government after the peace at Appomattox, The Lost Colony of the Confederacy is the first book to focus on this mass migration. Eugene C. Harter vividly describes the lives of these last Confederates who founded their own city and were called Os Confederados by the Brazilians. They retained much of their Southernness and lent an American flavor to Brazilian culture. The cultural province they established still exists as testimony to the hardiness of Southern ways. First published in 1985, this work details the background of the exodus and describes the life of the twentieth-century descendants, who have a strong link both to Southern history and to modern Brazil. The fires have cooled, but it is useful to understand the intense feelings that sparked the migration to Brazil and other areas of the globe. Southern ways have melded into Brazilian, and both are linked by the unbreakable bonds of history, as shown in this revealing account.\",['Eugene C. Harter'],Texas A&M University Press,2000\n",

Looking at history from the bottom up, the history of working people and peasants, Hazan asks: How did they see their opportunities? What were they fighting for? What was the Terror and could it be justified? And how was the revolution stopped in its tracks? This is vivid historical writing - the multitude of voices of the Revolution come to life.

Set in a dangerous near future world, The Book of M tells the captivating story of a group of ordinary people caught in an extraordinary catastrophe who risk everything to save the ones they love. It is a sweeping debut that illuminates the power that memories have not only on the heart, but on the world itself. One afternoon at an outdoor market in India, a man's shadow disappears-an occurrence science cannot explain. He is only the first. The phenomenon spreads like a plague, and while those afflicted gain a strange new power, it comes at a horrible price: the loss of all their memories. Ory and his wife Max have escaped the Forgetting so far by hiding in an abandoned hotel deep in the woods. Their new life feels almost normal, until one day Max's shadow disappears too. Knowing that the more she forgets, the more dangerous she will become to Ory, Max runs away. But Ory refuses to give up the time they have left together. Desperate to find Max before her memory disappears completely, he follows her trail across a perilous, unrecognizable world, braving the threat of roaming bandits, the call to a new war being waged on the ruins of the capital, and the rise of a sinister cult that worships the shadowless. As they journey, each searches for answers: for Ory, about love, about survival, about hope; and for Max, about a new force growing in the south that may hold the cure. Like The Passage and Station Eleven, this haunting, thought-provoking, and beautiful novel explores fundamental questions of memory, connection, and what it means to be human in a world turned upside down.\",['Peng Shepherd'],HarperCollins,2018-06-05\n",
